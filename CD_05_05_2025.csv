However, as domain rules grow complex, LCD platforms may fail to do so effectively. Generative AI, driven by large language models (LLMs), offers source code generation from natural language but suffers from its non-deterministic black-box nature and limited explainability. Therefore, rather than having LLMs generate entire applications from single prompts, we advocate for a white-box approach allowing citizen developers to specify domain models semi-formally, attaching constraints and operations as natural language annotations. These annotations are fed incrementally into an LLM contextualized with the generated application stub. This results in deterministic and better explainable generation of static application components, while offering citizen developers an appropriate level of abstraction. We report on a case study in manufacturing execution systems, where the implementation of the approach provides first insights. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","artificial intelligence; large language models; low-code; Model-driven engineering; semi-formal","Behavioral research; Code development; Development platform; Domain model; Language model; Large language model; Low-code; Model-driven Engineering; Natural languages; Semi-formal; White box; Industrial research","","","","","Bernardi M.L., Casciani A., Cimitile M., Marella A., Conversing with business process-aware Large Language Models: the BPLLM framework; Buchmann T., Valkyrie: A UML-based Model-driven Environment for Model-driven Software Engineering, Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Software Paradigm Trends (ICSOFT 2012), pp. 147-157, (2012); Fill H.-G., Fettke P., Kopke J., Conceptual Modeling and Large Language Models: Impressions From First Experiments With ChatGPT, Enterp.

Numerous studies confirm that digital literacy competence accelerates students’ academic achievement and recommend incorporating digital literacy competence in academic syllabi in higher education to equip students with the competencies. This study aims to cultivate digital literacy competence, specifically Information and data literacy, through a class intervention in English for Academic Purposes (EAP) courses for engineering undergraduate students. The class intervention incorporates one area of digital literacy competencies, information and data literacy, as stated in DigCom 2.0 Framework – a digital competence framework for citizens developed by the European Commission. This qualitative study executes a case study approach using photovoice (PV) to investigate students’ experience and competence development in information and data literacy since (PV) can be used to portray changes and experiences while acquiring a specific competence. This study involves 20 out of 78 taking EAP classes as general courses, and data are collected through learning journals to capture students’ learning experiences using photovoice. The collected data are analyzed using an emotional geography framework, which explores how people experience and express their emotions during interaction with their environment, including people and circumstances. These emotions are categorized into several areas: personal, physical, moral, professional, and political. The result shows that the class intervention has brought about a new understanding of digital literacy and the student’s awareness of information and data literacy. Before the class, they considered digital literacy competence merely operating digital devices. After the class, they recognized the importance of information and data literacy and techniques to evaluate information from online sources by considering its currency, relevancy, author, accuracy, and purpose. Therefore, this study recommends incorporating digital literacy into all disciplines and further study on other core competencies in digital literacy, as suggested in DigCom 2.0. © (2024), (Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia).

As they rely heavily on graphical languages rather than writing code, these platforms enable citizen developers to participate in software development. However, creating new LCDPs is very costly, since it requires building support for graphical modelling and its integration with services like model validation, recommendation systems, or code generation. While Model-driven Engineering (MDE) has developed technologies to create these components, most of them are not cloud-based, as required by LCDPs. In particular, a cloud-based graphical workbench capable of providing the scalability required by industrial applications and adequately supporting technological heterogeneity is currently missing. To fill this gap we introduce Dandelion, a cloud-based graphical language workbench for LCDPs built following an MDE approach. The tool handles model heterogeneity by using a harmonising meta-model to uniformly represent models from diverse technologies, and supports a customisable level of conformance between models and meta-models. Scalability is addressed by persisting models in a distributed, highly flexible database whose infrastructure is designed to conform to the harmonising meta-model, thus favouring model retrieval. Additionally, a customisable scalability component is introduced for lazy model loading. This paper describes the concepts and principles behind the tool design and reports on an evaluation on large synthetic process mining models, and on domain-specific languages and large industrial models used within the UGROUND company, showing promising results. © 2023 The Author(s)","(Meta-)Modelling; Graphical languages; Low-code development platforms; Model scalability; Model-driven engineering","Graphic methods; Modeling languages; Problem oriented languages; Software design; (meta-)modeling; Cloud-based; Code development; Development platform; Graphical languages; Low-code development platform; Meta model; Metamodeling; Model scalability; Model-driven Engineering; Scalability","","","","","Brambilla M., Cabot J., Wimmer M., Model-Driven Software Engineering in Practice, Second Edition, Synthesis Lectures on Software Engineering, (2017); UML 2.5.1 OMG specification, (2017); Kelly S., Tolvanen J., Domain-Specific Modeling - Enabling Full Code Generation, (2008); Ruscio D.D., Kolovos D.S., de Lara J., Pierantonio A., Tisi M., Wimmer M., Low-code development and model-driven engineering: Two sides of the same coin?, Softw.

Changes in immigration policy, focused on increased deportation enforcement, within the last three decades have led to an increased fear of deportation and unique circumstances mixed-status families must navigate. These circumstances, combined with fear of deportation, have had deleterious effects on the psychological well-being of the family, in general, and the children, in particular. This paper reviews the impact of immigration policies on Latinx/é mixed-status families, the unique circumstances of mixed-status families, and the mental health implications these have on the children specifically. Articles and books were selected from various sources that addressed Latinx/é mental health, mixed-status families, and immigration. After a review of the literature, these circumstances emerged: familial separation, citizen children second-class citizenry, developmental implications, psychological implications, and coping mechanisms and strategies of mixed-status families. Recommendations for mental health providers who work with children from mixed-status families are provided. © 2024 by the authors.","immigration; Latinx/é children; mental health","child; deportation; epidemiology; family; fear; female; Hispanic; human; immigration; male; mental health; migration policy; psychological well-being; review","","","","","Passel J.S., Krogstad J.M., What We Know About Unauthorized Immigrants Living in the U.S, (2023); Vargas E.D., Pirog M.A., Mixed-Status Families and WIC Uptake: The Effects of Risk of Deportation on Program Use*, Soc.

It is based on the assumption that sport should be the focus of state attention and public policies as a citizenship development strategy. The main objective is to comparatively analyze the sports legislation in Brazil and Portugal, especially the acts that established the general rules for this sector at the national level. For this, descriptive-analytical research with a qualitative approach and exploratory scope was carried out, organized from fieldwork and analysis and treatment of empirical and documentary material. The content analysis of the documents confirmed that in Brazil funding is the main issue in the state’s normative action, while in Portugal the regulatory exercise is the main concern. In both countries, it was possible to observe the impact of mega-events in the legislative sphere, with the production of exceptional acts. © 2024, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul.

But limited resources, weak civil society, and a history of authoritarian politics make building subnational democratic institutions daunting. Do participatory institutions expand accountability in these environments? We address this question by evaluating citizen decision-making in Kenya's local participatory processes. We first administered a survey experiment surrounding citizens' development policy preferences to 9,928 respondents in four Kenyan counties. We then nest this survey experiment in participant observation and over 80 elite interviews. Our conclusions are mixed: respondents readily change their policy preferences to align with the government's policy actions, which suggests limited prospects for accountability. However, respondents use participatory budgeting venues to question government officials about missing projects, which provides a potential foundation for accountability. Yet, uncompetitive local elections, the absence of independent civil society's participation, and new program rules are likely to limit democratic accountability.  © The Author(s), 2023.

Understanding migrant workers' settlement intentions is crucial for their citizenship development. Based on the fundamental role of the right to life and health, equalization of basic public health services is essential. Therefore, understanding the potential impact of public health services equalization on the settlement intention of migrant workers is crucial in China’s new urbanization. Method: In this study, we utilized data from the 2017 wave of China Migrants Dynamic Survey (CMDS) and employed the Propensity Score Matching method to investigate the impact of basic public health service equalization policy on the settlement intention of migrant workers. Additionally, we utilized the Mediation Effect Model to uncover the impact mechanism. Results: Our findings indicate that basic public health service equalization policy has a significant positive effect on increasing the settlement intention of migrant workers, with an even greater effect observed among the low-income group, the cross-provincial subsample, and the new generation subsample. The results of the Mediation Effect Model suggest that Basic public health service equalization policy can bolster the subjective integration willingness and subjective identity of migrant workers, thereby enhancing their settlement intention. Conclusion: Based on the results, we propose to strengthen the promotion of the basic public health service equalization policy and expand the coverage of health records to further increase the settlement intention of migrant workers. © The Author(s) 2024.","Basic public health services equalization; Mediating effect model; Migrant workers; Settlement intention","article; China; citizenship; cohort analysis; controlled study; cross-sectional study; human; information processing; lowest income group; male; migrant; migrant worker; propensity score; public health; public health service; right to life; urbanization","","","","","Zhu Y., China's migrant workers and their settlement intention in the cities: Beyond the Hukou reform[J], Habitat Int, 31, 1, pp. 65-76, (2007); Wang F., Zuo X., Inside China's cities: Institutional barriers and opportunities for urban migrants [J], American Economic Review, 89, 2, pp. 276-280, (1999); Zhu Y., Chen W., The settlement intention of China's migrant workers in the cities: Recent changes and multifaceted individual-level determinants[J], Popul Space Place, 16, 4, pp. 253-267, (2010); Hu F., Xu Z.Y., Chen Y.Y., Circular migration, or permanent stay?

Low-code has gained significant momentum in the last years and some studies have already reported the use of this technology to digitalize workflows and processes in a variety of business scenarios. Nevertheless, to-date there is no research evaluating the implications of this technology to support digitalization in construction industry. Based on a hybrid research approach combining literature review, case study, and surveys, this paper addresses this gap by evaluating the benefits and limitations of using low-code in the construction industry context. The study reveals that low-code productive application development practices have the potential to enable different degrees of digitalization and innovation in specific construction processes. The study also recognizes the relevance of adopting a strategic approach to fully leverage low-code at an organizational construction firm level and identifies several areas for further research. This includes leveraging synergies with industry-relevant subjects such as lean construction, Building Information Modelling, the Internet of Things, and Industry 4.0, among others. © 2023 The Author(s)","Building information modelling; Citizen developer; Construction industry; Digitalization; Industry 4.0; Lean construction; Low-code","Construction; Industry 4.0; Information theory; Lean production; Building Information Modelling; Citizen developer; Code development; Coding skills; Computing skills; Digital solutions; Digitalization; Lean construction; Low-code; Operational needs; Construction industry","","","","","Bock A.C., Frank U., Low-code platform, Bus.

Revealing the relevance of this phenomenon and the level of its research, the authors notice that the studies of other researchers lack a holistic approach and present a clearer systematic assessment, presenting research on public citizenship and modernization in a sustainable environment. Additionally, the interaction between these two components and the corresponding directions was not analyzed at all. By naming the existing scientific problem, the authors of the article aim to fill this conceptual and empirical gap. The stated goal and tasks of the article respond to the scientific problem and the achieved results. The authors studied the variables of public citizenship assessment; performed an analysis of social, economic and environmental aspects and substantiated the interaction between the expression of modernization changes and the formation of civil society, distinguishing the factors promoting and limiting community citizenship. Therefore, the authors emphasize that the new theoretical construct proposed in the presented model will help to fill methodological gaps in the scientific literature and, in making practical decisions, will stimulate scientific debate. First of all, the paper discusses the conceptual issues of the expression of modernization of civil society, highlighting and justifying the interaction of social changes and sustainable environment in economic, social, political, environmental, and cultural aspects, presenting the case of Lithuania (The Case of Lithuania). On the other hand, following the document of the Sustainable Development Strategy of the United Nations, the field of progress and resilience of Lithuanian society in a modern society is discussed, identifying and analyzing various criteria that have been empirically tested. The authors noted that the democratic cube model was used to create a theoretical model of public citizenship development in a harmonious environment, and the HDI model (human development index) was also integrated. The model created by the authors systematically explains the analysis of the relationship between the expression of modernization changes identified in the research and the formation of civil society; second, it substantiates the process of interaction between modernization changes and public citizenship, discussing four fields of expression. Practically, the model will help researchers conceptually analyze and empirically study public citizenship; will help public policymakers and implementers to manage effectively, ensuring quality changes in society and managing new challenges, and it will also contribute to the conceptual formation of the country’s long-term development strategy. © 2023 by the authors.","citizenship; development; model; public; sustainable","Lithuania; citizenship; civil society; development strategy; environmental factor; holistic approach; model; modernization; socioeconomic impact; sustainability; sustainable development","","","","","Kanger L., Schot J., Deep transitions: Theorizing the long-term patterns of socio-technical change, Environ.

These span from individual consumption choices, to taking part in forms of collective action to steer the behaviour of governments and in the private sector. Here we analyse data from the Net Zero Diaries project to explore how attitudes to different forms of climate citizenship develop as people become more aware about the scale of societal change required to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The Net Zero Diaries project was a deliberative mini-public, composed of 41 citizens broadly representative of the UK adult population, which convened over five months between 2021 and 2022 to debate the UK policies for reaching net zero emissions by 2050. We show that people identify government as the prime actor needed to drive the transition, but doubt that they will act due to a range of constraints vis-à-vis the public and private sector. This tension provides a novel explanation for why some people prioritise forms of individual and consumption focused climate citizenship, whilst also doubting the efficacy of such actions. We conclude by suggesting that efforts to drive more engaged forms of climate citizenship need to attend to underlying feelings about state efficacy, rather than focus on just how the issue of climate change is framed. © The Author(s) 2024.","Climate citizenship; Deliberative mini-publics; Public attitudes; Public engagement","Adult populations; Carbon emissions; Climate citizenship; Collective action; Deliberative mini-public; Private sectors; Public attitudes; Public engagement; Societal changes; Zero carbons; carbon emission; citizenship; climate change; collective action; private sector; public attitude","","","","","Agnone J., Amplifying public opinion: the policy impact of the U.S. environmental movement, Soc Forces, 85, 4, pp. 1593-1620, (2007); Ainscough J., Willis R., Embedding deliberation: Guiding the use of deliberative mini-publics in climate policy-making, Clim Policy, pp. 1-15, (2024); Anderson B., Affect and critique: a politics of boredom*, Environ Plan D Soc Space, 39, 2, pp. 197-217, (2021); Andrews N., Elstub S., McVean S., Sandie G., Scotland's Climate Assembly Research Report - process, impact and assembly member experience, Scottish Government Research, Edinburgh, UK, (2022); Bain P.G., Milfont T.L., Kashima Y., Bilewicz M., Doron G., Gardarsdottir R.B., Gouveia V.V., Guan Y., Johansson L.-O., Pasquali C., Corral-Verdugo V., Aragones J.I., Utsugi A., Demarque C., Otto S., Park J., Soland M., Steg L., Gonzalez R., Lebedeva N., Madsen O.J., Wagner C., Akotia C.S., Kurz T., Saiz J.L., Schultz P.W., Einarsdottir G., Saviolidis N.M., Co-benefits of addressing climate change can motivate action around the world, Nat Clim Chang, 6, 2, pp. 154-157, (2015); Boulianne S., Ohme J., Pathways to environmental activism in four countries: social media, environmental concern, and political efficacy, J Youth Stud, 25, 6, pp. 771-792, (2021); Britain talks climate: A toolkit for engaging the British public on climate change, Britain Talks Climate, (2020); The Net Zero Diaries: A Citizens Perspective on Tackling the Climate Emergency, (2022); Buller A., Doing Well by Doing Good?

Global citizenship is particularly important for emerging health professionals with many health challenges of the 21st century being of global importance. Yet, evidence on the effectiveness of STSA is inconclusive, predominantly due to methodological issues limiting research to date. This quasi-experimental study draws on a recognized global citizenship framework encompassing dimensions of social responsibility, global competence, and global civic engagement to examine the changes in global citizenship pre- and post-STSA experience in health students. The sample consisted of health students (n = 75) who participated in an STSA experience (study tour or practicum) from 16 to 22 days in a less industrialized country and a control group (n = 66) who did not partake in any intervention. The data analysis found that students in the intervention group had significant improvements in their overall global citizenship score and its dimensions separately, except for social responsibility, while no significant changes were seen in the control group. The findings provide evidence to support STSA experiences as an accessible option for universities to promote global citizenship development among health students. © 2024 by the authors.","civic engagement; global awareness; global citizenship education; global mobility; impact evaluation; social responsibility; study tours","","","","","","Borkovic S., Nicolacopoulos T., Horey D., Fortune T., Students positioned as global citizens in Australian and New Zealand universities: A discourse analysis, High.

Nevertheless, municipalities face constraints in addressing these challenges, with smaller, remote municipalities being particularly susceptible. They often cover expansive geographical areas with high landslide risk, yet have limited financial resources, expertise, and personnel for climate adaptation. Consequently, the active involvement of citizens in adaptation plays an important role in these remote places. This paper investigates how citizens of three small remote communities deal with landslides, emphasizing the role of people–place relations in shaping adaptive practices. Grounded in assemblage theory, our analysis reveals that most citizens maintained a pragmatic relation to landslides, while only a few expressed concern. Regardless of the degree of concern, all citizens constructed landslides as integral element within their socio-material place assemblages, as part of their lives in the respective places. Furthermore, citizens developed various adaptive practices, including nature observation, reporting to authorities, and implementing practical preventive measures to control water that could trigger landslides. These practices are manifestations of socio-material assemblages that have evolved through citizens’ relations to their specific places. Importantly, irrespective of the level of concern regarding landslides, these practices were carried out as part of everyday life. Through these practices, enabled by experience-based, embodied, and often tacit local knowledge, citizens acted as community guardians. Thus, comprehensive people–place relations emerge as a pivotal factor for a community’s adaptative capacity in the face of climate change-induced hazards. © The Author(s) 2024.","Citizens; Climate adaptation; Landslides; Norway; Place; Socio-material assemblage","","","","","","Amundsen H., Place attachment as a driver of adaptation in coastal communities in Northern Norway, Local Environ, 20, 3, pp. 257-276, (2015); Anderson B., McFarlane C., Assemblage and geography, Area, 43, 2, pp. 124-127, (2011); Anderson B., Keanes M., McFarlane C., Swanton D., On assemblages and geography, Dialogues Hum Geogr, 2, 2, pp. 171-189, (2012); Arora S., Van Dyck B., Sharma D., Stirling A., Control, care, and conviviality in the politics of technology for sustainability, Sustain: Sci Pract Pol, 16, 1, pp. 247-262, (2020); Berroeta H., Lais de Carvalho P., Castillo-Sepulveda J., The place–subjectivity continuum after a disaster: enquiring into the production of sense of place as an assemblage, Changing senses of place: navigating global challenges, pp. 43-52, (2021); Bingham A.J., From data management to actionable findings: a five-phase process of qualitative data analysis, Int J Qual Methods, 22, pp. 1-11, (2023); Bonaiuto M., Alves S., De Dominicis S., Petrocelli I., Place attachment and natural hazard risk: research review and agenda, J Environ Psychol, 48, pp. 33-53, (2016); Brink E., Wamsler C., Citizen engagement in climate adaptation surveyed: the role of values, worldviews, gender and place, J Clean Prod, 209, pp. 1342-1353, (2019); Cieslik K., Shakya P., Uprety P., Dewulf A., Russell C., Et al., Building resilience to chronic landslide hazard through citizen science, Front Earth Sci, 7, (2019); Dapilah F., Nielsen J.O., Friis C., The role of social networks in building adaptive capacity and resilience to climate change: a case study from northern Ghana, Clim Dev, 12, 1, pp. 42-56, (2020); De Dominicis S., Fornara F., Ganucci Cancellieri U., Twigger-Ross C., Bonaiuto M., We are at risk, and so what?

Through meticulous research into single-family housing in Toronto, encompassing aspects such as zoning regulations, historical typologies, strategies for conversion and costs, ReHousing strives to serve as a platform for citizen empowerment. Its primary objective is to foster the emergence of a new type of housing developers, referred to as “citizen developers.” On the other hand, “Santiago, Cooperative City,” is a thesis and professional degree project presented in the MARQ UC program. Inspired by a contemporary reinterpretation of Alison and Peter Smithson’s ideas on housing and social interaction, this project reimagines the residential densification of downtown Santiago, taking as its starting point the site of the historic international architecture competition for the remodeling of downtown Santiago (1972). © 2024, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile.

Citizen developers, non-technical employees who leverage LCNC platforms, are at the heart of this trend. While many firms perceive LCNC and citizen development as a crucial component of their digital transformation strategy, little is known about the evolving roles in this field or the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSA). To address this knowledge gap, we processed 113,106 job postings published on Indeed.com. Our topic modeling methodology identified 34 KSA topics and classified them into the three domains platform, business, and technology. We contribute to research by empirically demonstrating which competencies are required to successfully work in the LCNC field.

The article raises the challenges of implementing normativity in urban spaces equipped with technical systems with artificial intelligence. The improvement of urban life is come through access to technology also the emergence of smart cities is, but not everyone welcomes the predictability and transparency it brings. The introduced artificial agents influence the existing system of normativity in the city, abolishing any norms, transforming, and generating others. Such influence cannot always predict accurately, so it is not possible to expect cultural and religious organizations, individual scientists, or government institutions to finally provide a definite list of moral norms and social rules, which need to implement into technical systems. It is worth noting that if existing norms and regulations are insufficient, then citizens develop their own models of interaction. In addition to rational and effective decision-making, it needs for the technical system needs to earn the trust of the citizens whose daily lives it regulates. The article outlines three caveats for morally correct decision-making mechanisms. First, they should be ongoing measures against distortion. Second, prevention of 'social blindness' on the part of developers. Third, controlling the use of techniques that attract users' attention while being addictive or negatively affecting users in general. These three caveats can be the basis for engineers, social researchers, and urban communities to begin working together conceptually to form morally correct smart city solutions.  © 2024 IEEE.","embodied AI systems; moral city; moral norms; normativity; smart city","Behavioral research; Decision making; AI systems; Artificial agents; Decisions makings; Embodied AI system; Human actions; Moral city; Moral norm; Normativity; Quantitative data; Technical systems; Smart city","","","","","Park R.E., The urban community as a spacial pattern and a moral order, The urban Community.

However, the lack of technical insight among citizen developers poses potential security risks. This research aims to support businesses adopting citizen development by providing a framework that helps to proactively identify security risks by also linking them to specific actors and tools needed during the system design and development process to mitigate those risks. Additionally, this framework helps to address knowledge gaps by outlining actionable steps to ensure secure low-code development practices. The research aims to answer the question: ""How can contextual information be modeled in low-code platforms to proactively identify and address security-related issues, acting as a virtual mentor for citizen / low-code developers?"". To answer this question, our research conceptualizes security risks from established frameworks and operational security methodologies into a practical framework that allows mapping security risks to the context of low-code development. This framework serves as a foundational platform for designing and integrating active process-oriented guidance within low-code platforms using model-based automated prompts. This approach additionally aligns with DevSecOps principles that allows enhancing the capacity for low-code approach and citizen development in areas that currently may include manual coding and integrations. © 2024 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).","DevOps; DevSecOps; Low Code Development; Modeling; Recommenders; Security","Code development; Devsecop; Integrating process; Low code development; Modeling; Process-oriented; Recommender; Security; Security risk managements; Security risks; Risk management","","","","","Rokis K., Kirikova M., Challenges of low-code/no-code software development: A literature review, International Conference on Business Informatics Research, pp. 3-17, (2022); Di Ruscio D., Kolovos D., de Lara J., Pierantonio A., Tisi M., Wimmer M., Low code development and model-driven engineering: Two sides of the same coin?, Software and Systems Modeling, 21, 2, pp. 437-446, (2022); Sedrakyan G., Snoeck M., Lightweight semantic prototyper for conceptual modeling, Advances in Conceptual Modeling: ER 2014 Workshops, ENMO, MoBiD, MReBA, QMMQ, SeCoGIS, WISM, and ER Demos, 33, pp. 298-302, (2014); Sedrakyan G., Snoeck M., A PIM-to-Code requirements engineering framework, International Conference on Model-Driven Engineering and Software Development, 2, pp. 163-169, (2013); Sedrakyan G., Poelmans S., Snoeck M., Assessing the influence of feedback-inclusive rapid prototyping on understanding the semantics of parallel UML statecharts by novice modellers, Information and Software Technology, 82, pp. 159-172, (2017); Sedrakyan G., Snoeck M., Cognitive feedback and behavioral feedforward automation perspectives for modeling and validation in a learning context, Model-Driven Engineering and Software Development: 4th International Conference, MODELSWARD 2016, pp. 70-92, (2017); Sedrakyan G., Snoeck M., Feedback-enabled MDA-prototyping effects on modeling knowledge, International Workshop on Business Process Modeling, Development and Support, pp. 411-425, (2013); Ruiz J., Sedrakyan G., Snoeck M., Generating user interface from conceptual, presentation and user models with JMermaid in a learning approach, Proceedings of the XVI International Conference on Human Computer Interaction, pp. 1-8, (2015); Sedrakyan G., Snoeck M., Do we need to teach testing skills in courses on requirements engineering and modelling, CEUR workshop proceedings, 1217, pp. 40-44, (2014); TOGAF® Version 10, (2022); ISO/IEC/IEEE International Standard - Systems and software engineering - Life cycle processes - Requirements engineering, ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018, pp. 1-104, (2018); Mansfield-Devine S., DevOps: finding room for security, Network security, 2018, 7, pp. 15-20, (2018); Kim G., Humble J., Debois P., Willis J., Forsgren N., The DevOps handbook: How to create world-class agility, reliability, & security in technology organizations, (2021); Khan R.A., Khan S.U., Khan H.U., Ilyas M., Systematic literature review on security risks and its practices in secure software development, ieee Access, 10, pp. 5456-5481, (2022); Sedrakyan G., Jarvela S., Kirschner P., Conceptual framework for feedback automation and personalization for designing learning analytics dashboards, Conference EARLI SIG, 27, (2016)","","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM Special Interest Group on Software Engineering (SIGSOFT); et al.; Fabasoft; IEEE Technical Committee on Software Engineering (TCSE); IKARUS security software; Johannes Kepler University Linz","27th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems, MODELS Companion 2024","22 September 2024 through 27 September 2024","Linz","204157","","979-840070622-6","","","English","Proceedings: MODELS - ACM/IEEE Int.

The system simulates the linguistic and IT skills of a developer analyst. It is based on a human-machine dialogue interface and a no-code platform called “ONTOMANTICS”. The human-machine dialog system is responsible for understanding, specifying (with a human interlocutor) and describing business requirements, while the no-code platform provides an environment for the development, execution, deployment, supervision and management of business applications without computer code writing. The system enables non-developers and citizen developers to design applications that meet end users’ business needs. Moreover, it helps speed up the application development process. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Business applications; Human-machine dialog; Natural language processing; No-code","Enterprise resource management; Application development process; Business applications; Dialogue systems; End to end; Human-machine dialogue; IT skills; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; No-code; Linguistics","","","","","Chakraborty U., Roy S., Kumar S., Rise of Generative AI and Chatgpt: Understand How Generative AI and Chatgpt are Transforming and Reshaping the Business World, (2023); Rouam A., Mise En Place d’un Agent Conversationnel De développement De fonctionnalités métier, (2021); Heinroth T., Minker W., Introducing Spoken Dialogue Systems into Intelligent Environments, (2013); Raj S., Building Chatbots with Python: Using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, (2019); Weizenbaum J., ELIZA – Un programme informatique pour l’étude de la communication en langage naturel entre l’homme et la machine, Communications De l’ACM, (1966); Vaswani A., Et al., Attention is All You Need, (2017); Devlin J., Chang M.-W., Lee K., Toutanova K., BERT: Pre-Training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding, (2019); Radford A., Narasimhan K., Salimans T., Sutskever I., Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training, (2018); Auffarth B., Generative AI with Langchain.Build Large Language Model (LLM) Apps with Python, (2023); Jiang A.Q., Et al., Mixtral of Experts, (2024); Mejri S., L’unité Lexicale Au Carrefour Du Sens.

This study examines how individual engagement in shaping private and semi-public space could be viewed as a means of reframing the publicness of everyday life and thereby contributing to the shaping of cities. Through examining the rationale of build-by-people trials in Shanghai, categorising in stewarding practise, DIY tactic, and informal trial, this study anticipates shedding light on the particularities of publicness in the contemporary Chinese context. Drawing on empirical data from observation and interviews, the study discusses different facets of build-by-people trials, including the combination of desire and belief to push individuals to be a part of the public, contribution to forgotten spaces, impact on social relationships, as well as concerns on privatisation. The analysis demonstrates that the current ‘build-by-people’ trials have manifested their capacity to proactively engage concerned citizens, develop forgotten spaces, and advance a broader sense of publicness discourse. However, additional research is needed to investigate how to maximise the value of ‘build-by-people’ practises in a sustainable manner, and how to strategically advocate for more ‘public-isation’ processes while keeping the privatisation scenario from deteriorating. © author(s).","Build-by-people trials; People’s City; Public space; Publicness","","","","","","Akkar Z.

Existing research has mainly focused on the circumstances under which these autocratizing incumbents erode democracy and on the structural factors explaining the resilience of democratic institutions. Much less is known about the actors within those institutions and when they stand up against the autocratizing incumbent to defend democracy. In this article, we present a novel theoretical framework of democratic defence that focuses on the interaction between the incumbent, institutional elites, and citizens. Developing a two-level model of democratic defence, we show how the democratic defender’s personal interests, repression by the incumbent, the perceived ambiguity of the autocratic action, and the perceived credibility of the democratic defender interact to affect the occurrence of democratic defence. The resulting framework can guide future research on the role of specific actors in defending democracy. We demonstrate the utility of our framework with illustrative case studies of (attempted) democratic defence in Senegal (2011–2012) and Poland (2017–2018). An actor-based approach of democratic defence is crucial to understand what actions domestic and international actors can take to prevent (further) democratic recession. © 2023 The Author(s).

However, these measures are deemed to be insufficient to drive the participation rate. This study aims to understand the participation trend of citizens in marine DRM. On the basis of the theory of citizen participation’s ladder, public participation within marine DRM is categorized into non-participation, tokenistic participation, and substantive participation. Using organization theory, the government’s strategies for encouraging participation are classified into common approach (raising awareness), structural approach (innovating instruments), and cultural approach (developing citizenship). Considering the vignette experiment of 403 citizens in a coastal city of China that has historically been subject to marine disasters, it was found that effectiveness of the strategies, from highest to lowest, are citizenship development, risk education, and instruments innovation. At the individual level, psychological characteristics such as trust in the government, past disaster experience, and knowledge of marine DRM did not significantly influence citizens’ participation preferences. At the government level, even when citizens are informed about new participatory mechanisms and tools, they still tend to be unwilling to share responsibilities. However, self-efficacy and understanding the beneficial outcomes of their participation in marine (DRM) can positively impact the willingness to participate. The results show that to encourage public participation substantively in the marine DRM, it is important to cultivate a sense of civic duty and enhance citizens’ sense of ownership, fostering a closer and more equitable partnership between the state and society. © 2024 by author(s).","marine disaster risk management; organization theory; public awareness; public participation; vignette experiment","","","","","","Alexander D., Emergency command systems and major earthquake disasters, Journal of Seismology and Earthquake Engineering, 10, 3, pp. 137-146, (2008); Arnstein S.

It is easier to gain people’s attention to the need for change, to significantly increase the quantity and quality of energy-efficient retrofits in Europe when public authorities and governments are adopting the appropriate approach. It is therefore important to demonstrate exemplary solutions at frequently used buildings like schools, universities, and science centers. Based on the concept of the Living Labs and the New European Bauhaus (NEB) initiatives, NEB–LAB initiative (www.eco2-schools.eu/) will work as a ‘think and do tank' to co-create, prototype or even test new tools, solutions, and policy recommendations in the school settings toward more holistic or even challenging Whole–School Approaches. Hence, through the NEB—LAB, school communities will: (i) develop citizen awareness—raising activities spreading the concept of energy and resource—efficient building and renovating, and (ii) promote education and training for sustainability, helping all actors (school staff, students, families, citizens) development competences and positive behaviors toward an environmentally respectful energy use. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Education for Sustainable Development (ESD); European Green Deal (EGD); Living Labs (LLs); New European Bauhaus (NEB); Whole–School Approach (WSA)","Energy efficiency; Laboratories; Personnel training; Bauhaus; Education for sustainable development; Energy efficient; European green deal; Living lab; New european bauhaus; Quality of energies; Whole–school approach; Sustainable development","","","","","Dobson A., Environmental citizenship: towards sustainable development, Sustain.

One factor that is often seen as contributing to this growing trend are social media, particularly Facebook. However, so far, research that examines the relation between social media use and affective polarization is still scarce, and the studies that exist are inconclusive and often focus on two-party systems. Using data from a panel survey conducted around the 2019 elections in Flanders, this study sets out to investigate to what extent Facebook (news) use relates to affective polarization, specifically in the context of a multi-party system. We find evidence that Facebook news use is indeed associated with higher levels of affective polarization and that citizens who rely on Facebook for their news consumption become more affectively polarized over the span of an electoral campaign than those who relied on other media channels. Moreover, we demonstrate that this relationship exists because Facebook news relates both to increased positive feelings toward the in-group, and increased hostile feelings toward the out-group, although the latter to a lesser extent. © Springer Nature Limited 2024.","Affective polarization; Echo chambers; Facebook; Social media; Survey research","","","","","","Aiello L.M., Barrat A., Schifanella R., Cattuto C., Markines B., Menczer F., Friendship Prediction and Homophily in Social Media, ACM Transactions on the Web, 6, 2, pp. 9-33, (2012); Allcott H., Braghieri L., Eichmeyer S., Gentzkow M., The Welfare Effects of Social Media, American Economic Review, 110, 3, pp. 629-676, (2020); Auter Z.J., Fine J.A., Negative Campaigning in the Social Media Age: Attack Advertising on Facebook, Political Behavior, 38, 4, pp. 999-1020, (2016); Bakshy E., Messing S., Adamic L.A., Exposure to Ideologically Diverse News and Opinion on Facebook, Science, 348, 6239, pp. 1130-1132, (2015); Banda K.K., Cluverius J., Elite Polarization, Party Extremity, and Affective Polarization, Electoral Studies, 56, pp. 90-101, (2018); Beam M.A., Hutchens M.J., Hmielowski J.D., Facebook News and (de)polarization: Reinforcing Spirals in the 2016 US Election, Information, Communication and Society, 21, 7, pp. 940-958, (2018); Buyens W., Van Aelst P., Alternative Media, Alternative Voices?

In parallel, recent AI-powered tools such as Copilot and ChatGPT generate programs from natural language instructions. We argue that these modalities are complementary: tools like ChatGPT greatly reduce the need to memorize large APIs but still require their users to read (and modify) textual programs, whereas visual tools abstract away most or all program text but struggle to provide easy access to large APIs. At their intersection, we propose LowCoder, the first low-code tool for developing AI pipelines that supports both a visual programming interface (LowCoderVP) and an AI-powered natural language interface (LowCoderNL). We leverage this tool to provide some of the first insights into whether and how these two modalities help programmers by conducting a user study. We task 20 developers with varying levels of AI expertise with implementing four ML pipelines using LowCoder, replacing the LowCoderNL component with a simple keyword search in half the tasks. Overall, we find that LowCoder is especially useful for (i) Discoverability: using LowCoderNL, participants discovered new operators in 75% of the tasks, compared to just 32.5% and 27.5% using web search or scrolling through options respectively in the keyword-search condition, and (ii) Iterative Composition: 82.5% of tasks were successfully completed and many initial pipelines were further successfully improved. Qualitative analysis shows that AI helps users discover how to implement constructs when they know what to do, but still fails to support novices when they lack clarity on what they want to accomplish. Overall, our work highlights the benefits of combining the power of AI with low-code programming. © 2024 Owner/Author.","","Abstracting; Application programming interfaces (API); Information retrieval;

However, due to the created flows often not being optimized and the fine-grained nature of the RPA instructions, these models quickly become complex and extensive, complicating their maintenance and comprehensibility. In this paper, we draw inspiration from the related fields of software programming and business process modeling to introduce complexity metrics for RPA bot models. These allow to objectively measure and compare the complexity of such workflows, and can thus, for example, provide an indication of where to start refactoring models in the bot repository. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Complexity; Metrics; Modeling; Robotic Process Automation","Botnet; Chatbots; Computer software maintenance; Microrobots; Nanorobots; Robot programming; Bot models; Business-users; Complexity; GraphicaL model; Light weight; Metric; Modeling; Process automation; Robotic process automation; Work-flows; Bot (Internet)","","","","","van der Aalst W.M.P., Bichler M., Heinzl A., Robotic process automation, Bus.

Technology enables end-users to create their own application for particular usage. This paper aims to present low code application development methodology resulting from practical experience as well as from the literature survey. The paper findings present that the low code development cycle (LCDC) is different in comparison with traditional or agile software development methods. The LCDC should emphasize the role, competencies, and experience of the end-user, who is a low code developer. This paper consists of two main parts. The first part covers literature surveys on contemporary approaches to citizen software development and low coding. The second part covers the LCDC ecosystem and process, which reveals the main active role of end-user and supportive roles of other project stakeholders, i.e., analysts, software engineers, testers, integrators, and other facilitators. © The Author(s) 2024.","Citizen development; Ecosystem; Life cycle; Low code; Process","Life cycle; Software design; Software testing; Citizen development; Code development; Development cycle; End-User Development; End-users; It supports; Literature survey; Low code; Process; Software applications; Application programs","","","","","Beccari M.N., Oliveira T.L., A philosophical approach about user experience methodology, Design, User Experience and Usability, Theory, Methods, Tools and Practice, pp. 13-22, (2011); Brouzos R., Panayiotou K., Tsardoulias E., Symeonidis A., A low-code approach for connected robots, J Intell Rob Syst Theory Appl, 108, 2, (2023); Callon M., Latour B., Unscrewing the big leviathan: How actors macro-structure reality and how sociologists help them to do so, Advances in Social Theory and Methodology: Towards an Integration of Micro and Macro-Sociologies, pp. 277-283, (1981); Chasanidou D., Gasparini A.A., Lee E., Design thinking methods and tools for innovation, Marcus A, pp. 12-23, (2015); Chaudhary H.A.A., Guevara I., Singh A., Schieweck A., John J., Margaria T., Pesch D., Efficient model-driven prototyping for edge analytics.

As a response, many companies are adopting low-code and no-code approaches to cultivate and empower a new cohort of employees: the citizen developers. While the practice community has been discussing the Citizen Development phenomenon for some time now, research lags behind, leading to a dearth of conceptual clarity in understanding the terms low-code, no-code, and Citizen Development. This paper connects the dots and proposes a more harmonized conceptual understanding of these related but distinct terms. Additionally, we explore the practical difficulties associated with Citizen Development approaches as identified by professionals in the field. Our key contribution is a clearer terminology and understanding of Citizen Development that can enhance both scholarly inquiry and practical application, facilitating clearer communication and more precise discussions. © 2024 Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI).

While the former are still software developers who implement the low- and no-code platforms, the latter use them to develop their domain applications. In practice, however, we believe that the citizen developer role is shared by two people. For example, in the teaching domain, the citizen developer role is shared between a teacher and his assistant. The first is the domain practitioner, while the second is the domain engineer. The Domain Engineer uses the development platform to create a tailored platform for the teacher, who uses it to create an application that will be for his students, the end users. To explore the possibility of differentiate these two roles in current low-code development platforms, we used two different low-code platforms—Mendix and OutSystems—to implement two case studies. These case studies reveal the limitations of current platforms for specializing platforms with functionalities close to those of low-code development platforms. To compare these two platforms, we consider a list of features that these platforms must satisfy.

These platforms enable citizen developers-non-technical employees within organizations-to build and manage applications that address specific business needs. This democratization accelerates time-to-market and encourages agile, co-participatory development. However, the rise of citizen development also introduces challenges, such as risks to quality, security, and governance, due to limited technical expertise among some users. This paper investigates ways to enhance current low-code practices by integrating AI-based support for text-to-model generation and established business frameworks, such as the Business Model Canvas (BMC). Incorporating BMC into low-code platforms reinforces their core strengths-minimizing code dependency while grounding development in business models. This integration can offer a structured pathway for citizen developers to engage in meaningful learning while ensuring their projects align with organizational objectives. This approach positions low-code not only as a productivity tool aiming faster time to market, but as platforms for continuous learning and strategic alignment with business. The proposed integrations build on a novel feedback-inclusive approach, which received the innovative feedback nomination at the University of Leuven, Belgium1, and was informed by evidence-based learning experiences at the University of Twente, Netherlands. © 2025 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.","AI-Enabled Modeling; Business Model Canvas; Business Models; Citizen Development; Low-Code; Model-Based System Development; Requirements Engineering for Low-Code","","","","","","Sedrakyan G., Snoeck M., A PIM-to-Code requirements engineering framework, International Conference on Model-Driven Engineering and Software Development, 2, pp. 163-169, (2013); Sedrakyan G., Snoeck M., Lightweight semantic prototyper for conceptual modeling, Advances in Conceptual Modeling: ER 2014 Workshops, ENMO, MoBiD, MReBA, QMMQ, SeCoGIS, WISM, and ER Demos, Atlanta, GA, USA, October 27-29, 2014.

Self-organized citizens develop these designs, but there is no support for the design process based on the co-creation and involvement of citizens. The latter are mainly non-experts. Three aspects characterize OSU: (1) OSU initiatives are initialized by citizens; (2) OSU initiatives are the new commons, are collectively created and managed by self-organized citizens; (3) to last, DIY should be accepted by or co-produced with the authorities as they can change the urban environment. This research offers a set of design principles to guide the cultivation of OSU infrastructures in the self-organized setting of urban commons. We derived the principles from an ethnographic study of an Amsterdam-based citizen initiative. This paper offers a set of design principles to guide the cultivation of OSU infrastructures in the self-organized setting of the urban commons. We introduce eight design principles: (1) Co-creation, (2) Trust-building, (3) Motivating, (4) Growing, (5) Showcasing, (6) Bridging, (7) Open-sourcing, and (8) Peer Production. By promoting self-organized, community-led development, our design principles offer guidelines for urban commons communities, academics, and decision-makers to work towards a shared vision of the future of inclusive cities. Building trust and gaining access to expertise are key aspects of OSU cultivation. © 2023, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","citizen initiatives; design ethnography; design principles; urban commons","Decision making; Design; Regional planning; Citizen initiative; Co-creation; Design ethnographies; Design Principles; Do it yourself; Open-source; Self-organised; Self-organize; Urban common; Urban design; Cultivation","","","","","Baskerville R.L., Myers M.D., Design ethnography in information systems, Inf.

The case of seaside resort city of Batumi reveals the Society’s aspiration to be sustainable and the local government’s intention to cope with ecological and social risks along with tourism industry actions oriented primarily on (as short run as possible) highest profits. The interest conflicts could be overcome by the orientation on the responsible traveler segment. The research presents the relationship between the level of environmental responsibility of the travelers and the level of environmentalfriendly actions of the locals, industry and local government. The modern tourism history of the city reveals the changes in the behavior of the citizens, developments in the strategies of the tourism industry actors and the modernization of measures the local government implements. It appears that these changes rely on the changes in the level of responsibility of the city’s visitors.

This already apparent loss of productivity has the software industry scrambling to fill the missing positions with citizen developers-Technical people with little or no programming skills-who would be using No-Code platforms to program various software solutions in specific domains. However, currently available platforms have fairly limited abstractions, lacking the flexibility of a general purpose programming language. To break the No-Code abstraction barrier, a very simple yet expressive general purpose No-Code programming language might provide citizen developers with an alternative to domain-specific No-Code platforms. Unfortunately, these requirements seem contradictory. Making a language very simple and specific might render it crippled, thus limited to a certain domain of problems. Conversely, making a language very expressive and general, might render it too complicated for citizen developers. In this work we argue that a multi-paradigm minimalist approach can bridge the gap between simplicity and expressiveness by including only abstractions considered intuitive to citizens. As a concrete proof-of-concept, we present a general purpose programming language designed for citizen developers that is on the one hand very powerful and on the other hand very simple. In fact, this language is so simple that the entire development is accomplished by flowcharts using mouse actions only, without typing a single line of code, thus demonstrating a general purpose No-Code programming language candidate for citizen developers.  © 2023 Owner/Author.","Citizen Developers; Golang; No-Code Software Development; Programming Language Design; Projectional Editing","Abstracting; Ada (programming language); Software design; Apparent loss; Citizen developer; Code programming; General-purpose programming language; Golang; No-code software development; Programming language design; Projectional editing; Simple++; Software industry; Mammals","","","","","Abdullah Al Alamin M., Malakar S., Uddin G., Afroz S., Bin Haider T., Iqbal A., 2021.

The development of this article is based on a quantitative study as well as qualitative analysis of generated statistical results and the role of the public institution in awareness, promotion, and management of the digital citizenry. In terms of quantitative analysis, a survey was conducted with a group of the population at university level aged 18–24 with 778 respondents. The questionnaire was based on 9 main traits of digital citizenship designed by Ribble and Bailey 2007. In terms of qualitative analysis, the article focuses on the main legal infrastructure and strategic documents of Kosovo to determine its standing on this new concept and a needs analysis followed by specific recommendations on how to deal with it. © The Author(s) 2024.","being online; Digital citizenship; digital citizenship management; digital rights; government; Kosovo; wellbeing online","","","","","","Barrett M., Oborn E., Orlikowski W., Creating value in online communities: The sociomaterial configuring of strategy, platform, and stakeholder engagement, Information Systems Research, 27, 4, pp. 704-723, (2016); Digital Citizenship, (2022); (2021); Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL LAYING DOWN HARMONISED RULES ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ACT) AND AMENDING CERTAN UNION LEGISLATIVE ACTS, COM/2021/206 final, (2021); Ferrari A., Digcomp B., A Framework for Developing and Understanding Digital Competence in Europe, (2013); Frau-Megis D., O'Neill B., Soriani A., Et al., Digital Citizenship Education: Overview and New Perspectives, (2022); Frau-Meigs D., O'Neill B., Soriani A., Et al., (2017); (2023); Hackenberry J., (2005); Handbook C., Digital Citizenship Education Handbook, (2022); Hu M., Cambridge analytica's Black Box, Big Data & Society, 7, 2, pp. 1-6, (2020); (2018); Kemp S., Digital 2023: Kosovo Report, (2023); (2021); Metz C., Schmidt G., (2023); (2022); Multi-Dimensional Analysis of Development in Kosovo, (2020); Ozturk G., Digital citizenship and its teaching: A literature review, Journal of Educational Technology and Online Learning, 4, 1, pp. 31-45, (2021); (2023); Ribble M., Bailey G., Digital Citizenship in Schools, (2007); Richtel M., Pearson C., Levenson M., (2023); Schilling D., (2020); Statistics K.A., General Report, (2019); Statistics K.A., General Statistics, (2022); (2021); (2023); Times T.H., (2022); (2021)","B.T.

While they remain strategically and economically important, trends in urbanization and technology have increased their relative sparsity and isolation making centralized government, service delivery and planning a challenge. Populations of their sub-jurisdictions are small and often exhibit significant heterogeneity in key demographic characteristics, not least between their Indigenous first residents and non-Indigenous citizens. Development of projection models for these areas is challenged by significant input data paucity, biases and structural issues related to the data collection and estimation architectures in place to gather input data across diverse and small populations. While this is the case, the demand for and importance of projections is no less for sparsely populated areas than elsewhere. Variants of the cohort component model are important tools for population projections for SPAs, with their grounding in the demographic accounting equation and modest input requirements. Nevertheless, to attain fit-for-purpose input data requires demographers to consider and select from a growing number of methods for smoothing issues with input data for projections for these regions. In this article we analyze the contributions of recent advances in methods for estimating fertility, mortality, and migration rates for small and diverse populations such as those in SPAs, focusing on the very sparsely populated jurisdiction of the Northern Territory of Australia. In addition to the contributions of our method itself, results at the detailed level demonstrate how abnormal and challenging ‘doing’ projections for sparsely populated areas can be. © The Author(s) 2024.","Expanding; Northern territory; P-TOPALS; Population projections; Smoothing; Sparsely populated areas","data envelopment analysis; demographic trend; environmental assessment; environmental policy; population dynamics; population outbreak; trend analysis","","","","","Population projections, Australia, (2017); Estimates and projections, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, Retrieved February 20, 2023, From, (2019); Selected living cost indexes, Australia, Retrieved April 19, 2023, From, (2023); ).

Many POPS in Seoul fail to offer a welcoming environment due to inadequate maintenance and illegal private use. In this study, we explored whether citizen participation can effectively enhance the management of POPS and reinforce the general public’s determination to reform public spaces. We involved nonprofessional citizens and local architects in simulated inspections and qualitative assessments of Seoul’s POPS. The citizens were able to effectively identify violations in POPS and provide more rigorous qualitative evaluations from a user perspective than experts. Following the inspection, the citizens developed a new sense of responsibility as stakeholders in urban public spaces. These findings reveal that citizen participation could make POPS more public and empower citizens to become active agents in improving public spaces. © The Author(s) 2024.","citizen participation; community engagement;

This paper explores the synergy between BaaS and the low-code or no-code development environments in Platform as a Service (PaaS) frameworks, examining opportunities, challenges, and implications for developers and organizations. LCDPs have gained popularity for simplifying application creation, empowering a broad spectrum of developers from citizen developers to experienced professionals. Concurrently, blockchain technology offers enhanced security and transparency but traditionally requires specialized skills for implementation. By embedding BaaS capabilities within LCDPs, developers can leverage blockchain benefits without extensive expertise, streamlining development processes and accelerating time-to-market for blockchain applications. Additionally, it addresses challenges related to security, scalability, and the complexity of managing blockchain operations within simplified development environments.

This paper investigates whether these technologies can be combined to be even more powerful. To do this, a solution concept and prototype implementation were developed. Using the prototype, one can describe desired changes in an Oracle Application Express (APEX) low-code application to the GPT-4 Turbo LLM in a chat. The LLM then performs the changes for the user by calling specific edit functions that the system offers and generates replies to the user. This solution enables citizen developers to edit a fully functional Web application through natural language without help from a professional software developer. We also present a qualitative user study that we performed with ten Oracle APEX customers. It showed that participants have a rather positive opinion of both the fundamental concept and the prototype, liking aspects like its time-savings and ease of use. The study also uncovered some problems like a lack of a common vocabulary or technical understanding between the LLM and some users. However, participants already suggested ways to remedy such problems like integrating an element inspector into the prototype. Overall, the study highlights the feasibility and potential of the system and outlines multiple directions for its further development. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.","","Software design; Software prototyping; Code development; Development platform; Entry barriers; Functionals; Language model; Prototype implementations; Software applications; Software developer; Software products; Solution concepts; Application programs","","","","","Aparicio S., Et al., Natural Language to SQL in Low-Code Platforms.; Cai Y., Et al., Low-Code LLM: Visual Programming over Llms; Calo T., Russis L.D., Leveraging large language models for end-user website generation, End-User Development-9Th International Symposium.

All these applications require large amounts of domain knowledge and are often highly individualized for each factory or company. Thus, implementation often lies in the hands of manufacturing engineers and needs to be integrated into their training. Low-code platforms and citizen developers depict a new and interesting way to implement digital systems in these areas: Domain experts with limited knowledge in software development can build apps through a graphical user interface, with only drag-and-drop and little program code of its own. On the other hand, several questions remain to be answered before such systems can be helpful for a larger audience in factory management. This contribution thus researches current trends for Citizen Developers and factory management and provides examples of promising applications, from the simplest to the most complex, used in both academic training at a learning factory of the TH Cologne as well as current research projects. Based on these examples, a two-fold survey is presented targeting the prospects and needs of actual citizen developers in manufacturing, the views of managers in this domain, and finally the implications for future training and education in learning factories. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Citizen Developers; Factory Management; Low Code","Graphical user interfaces; Industrial plants; Personnel training; Production control; Software design; 'current; Applications gaps; Citizen developer; Digital factories; Digital system; Learning factory; Low code; Management applications; Operation assets; Operations quality; Plant management","","","","","Geisberger E., Broy M., Living in a Networked World: Integrated Research Agenda Cyber-Physical Systems (agendaCPS), Herbert Utz, (2015); Neugebauer R., Et al., Trends in Industrie 4.0, (2016); Kagemann H., Et al., Recommendations for Implementing the Strategic Initiative Industrie 4.0, (2013); Vukovic M., Laredo J., Rajagopal S., API terms and conditions as a service, 2014 IEEE ISCS, pp. 386-393, (2014); McKendrick J., The Rise of the Empowered Citizen Developer, (2017); Mew L., Field D., A case study on using the mendix low code platform to support a project management course, EDSIG Conference, 2473, (2018); Pearson M., Et al., Pro Microsoft Power Platform: Solutionbuilding for Thecitizendeveloper, (2020); Krishnaraj N., Et al., Comparative study on various low code business process management platforms, ICICT, (2022); Lebens M., Et al., Rise of the citizen developer, Muma Bus.

This context prompts advanced cybersecurity measures and more frequent and thorough penetration testing to protect an organization's security posture. The scarcity of skilled expertise in cybersecurity today makes it challenging to cope with the evolving challenge and the growing demand. This paper introduces PENTESTAI, a novel framework for penetration testing automation using Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents leveraging the MITRE ATTACK knowledge base. The paper provides an overview of the current state of research on cybersecurity and LLM-powered agents, followed by a detailed description of PENTESTAI building blocks. A proof-of-concept implementation is discussed to validate the framework's core constructs. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research directions to achieve the highest level of penetration testing automation with average skilled human-agent collaboration and to create citizen penetration testers. © 2024 IEEE.","AI; AI Agents; automation; Citizen penetration tester; Cybersecurity; Large Language Models; MITRE ATTACK; penetration testing; vulnerabilities","Model checking; Multi agent systems; AI agent; Citizen penetration tester; Cyber security; Language model; Large language model; MITRE ATTACK; Multiagent framework; Penetration testing; Testing automation; Vulnerability; Knowledge based systems","","","","","Bishop M., About Penetration Testing, IEEE Security & Privacy, 5, 6, pp. 84-87, (2007); Shameli-Sendi A., Cheriet M., Bouarab H., Taxonomy of intrusion risk assessment and response system in cloud computing, J.

However, while software can be rapidly built through citizen development (CDD), organizations must look beyond implementation and consider whether software built by individuals with limited technical backgrounds is scalable and durable. In this study, we investigate the scalability of CDD in organizations by conducting a multivocal literature review, integrating both the current phenomenon (CDD) as well as related, established research streams like end-user development. We identify four dimensions affecting CDD scalability and four temporal stages of CDD maturity, and present these as a CDD scaling framework. Moreover, we identify three overarching themes in scaling CDD. Finally, we present an integrated research agenda based on the CDD scaling framework and overarching themes. © 2023 29th Annual Americas Conference on Information Systems, AMCIS 2023.

Roman heritage was often contested, with cities emphasising their claims as the true heirs of Rome. Siena has faced criticism for its lack of major historical sites. In response, its municipal authorities and citizens developed the legends of the “she-wolf” and Saint Ansanus. These legends reinforced Siena’s urban identity through historical narratives and public art. During the Renaissance, Siena redefined its history to assert its legitimacy by drawing on classical culture. This re-articulation of identity addressed historical rivalries and revealed the enduring complexity of local identity formation in Italy. This study examines historical legends and uses historical materials, such as city archives and artworks, to research the Italian city of Siena during the Renaissance and to investigate the origins of urban legends, their controversies, and how Siena created the legends of the “she-wolf” and Saint Ansanus. © 2025 by the author.","cultural memory; identity; Siena; urban legends","","","","","","Achilli A., Olivieria A., Palaa M., Metspalub E., Fornarinoa S., Battagliaa V., Accetturoa M., Kutuevb I., Khusnutdinovac E., Pennarunb E., Et al., Mitochondrial DNA Variation of Modern Tuscans Supports the Near Eastern Origin of Etruscans, American Journal of Human Genetics, 80, pp. 766-767, (2007); Alighieri D., Commedia: Inferno, Letteratura italiana Einaudi, (1991); Anderson C.A., Sacred Histories: Remembering the Christian Past in Medieval Tuscany (1100–1500), pp. 249-250, (2019); Ascheri M., Franco B., A History of Siena: From Its Origins to the Present Day, pp. 65-84, (2020); Assmann A., The History in Memory: From Personal Experience to Public Presentation, (2002); Bargagli Petrucci F., Notizie di un Arco Romano in Siena.

Yet, there have been few core strategies presented on how international HE programmes might realize such aims, and more research is needed. Furthermore, English language teaching (ELT) plays a central role in preparation and support for study abroad (SA) and internationalization in English medium education (EME), but has also been slow to incorporate intercultural education and intercultural citizenship. Hence, this study aimed to describe how Thai SA students developed a sense of intercultural citizenship during SA experiences with international HE programmes in Anglophone countries and identify roles ELT in facilitating the preparation for their subsequent SA programmes. Data were collected from semi-structured interviews (n = 14) conducted with students from three Thai universities who had experienced EME overseas education. From qualitative content analysis, findings revealed a range of understandings and responses to intercultural citizenship, English learning, language utilization, and the SA experiences. In addition, a mismatch was identified between ELT preparation and support efforts compared to the multilingual and multicultural reality of international HE. © 2022 National Institute of Education, Singapore.","English language teaching; English medium instruction; intercultural citizenship; intercultural citizenship education; internationalization of higher education; study abroad","","","","","","Aktas F., Pitts K., Richards J.C., Silova I., Institutionalizing global citizenship: A critical analysis of higher education programs and curricula, Journal of Studies in International Education, 21, 1, pp. 65-80, (2017); Baker W., English as an academic lingua franca and intercultural awareness: Student mobility in the transcultural university Language and Intercultural Communication, 16, 3, pp. 437-451, (2016); Baker W., Jarunthawatchai W., English Language Policy in Thailand, European Journal of Language Policy, 9, 1, pp. 27-44, (2017); Baker W., Huttner J., “We are not the language police”: Comparing multilingual EMI programmes in Europe and Asia, International Journal of Applied Linguistics, 29, 1, pp. 78-94, (2019); Baker W., Fang F., ‘So maybe I’m a global citizen’: Developing intercultural citizenship in English medium education, Language, Culture and Curriculum, 34, 1, pp. 1-17, (2021); Bayyurt Y., Akcan S., Current perspectives on pedagogy for ELF, (2015); Beaven A., Borghetti C., Editorial: Intercultural education for student mobility, Intercultural Education, 26, pp. 1-5, (2015); Boonsuk Y., Ambele E.A., McKinley J., Developing awareness of Global Englishes: Moving away from ‘native standards’ for Thai university ELT, System, 99, (2021); Boonsuk Y., Fang F., Re-Envisaging English medium instruction, intercultural citizenship development, and higher education in the context of studying abroad, Language and Education, pp. 1-17, (2021); Byram M., From foreign language education to education for intercultural citizenship: Essays and reflections, (2008); Byram M., Golubeva I., Hui H., Wagner M., From principles to practice in education for intercultural citizenship, (2016); Cresswell J.W., Clark V.P., Designing and Conducting Mixed Methods Research, (2011); Dafouz E., Smit U., ROAD-MAPPING English medium education in the internationalised university, (2020); Dearden J., English as a medium of instruction–A growing global phenomenon, (2014); Denzin N.K., Lincoln Y.S., Collecting and interpreting qualitative materials, (1998); Dornyei Z., Research methods in applied linguistics, (2007); Fang F., Baker W., ‘A more inclusive mind towards the world’: English language teaching and study abroad in China from intercultural citizenship and English as a lingua franca perspectives, Language Teaching Research, 22, 5, pp. 608-624, (2018); Galloway N., Rose H., Incorporating Global Englishes into the ELT classroom, ELT Journal, 72, 1, pp. 3-14, (2018); Gaudelli W., Global citizenship education: Everyday transcendence, (2016); Golubeva I., Wagner M., Yakimowski M., Comparing students’ perceptions of global citizenship in Hungary and the USA, From principles to practice in education for intercultural citizenship, pp. 3-24, (2017); Hanauer D.I., Multiple moments in poetry: The importance of the unique, The Canadian Modern Language Review, 60, 1, pp. 69-87, (2003); Isabelli-Garcia C., Bown J., Plews J.L., Dewey D.P., Language learning and study abroad, Language Teaching, 51, 4, pp. 439-484, (2018); Ishikawa T., EMF awareness in the Japanese EFL/EMI context, ELT Journal, 74, 4, pp. 408-417, (2020); Jackson J., Education abroad, The Routledge handbook of language and intercultural communication, pp. 449-463, (2012); Jackson J., Intervening in the intercultural learning of L2 study abroad students: From research to practice, Language Teaching, 51, 3, pp. 365-382, (2018); Jackson J., The language and intercultural dimension of education abroad, The Routledge Handbook of language and intercultural communication, pp. 442-456, (2020); Jenkins J., English as a lingua franca in the international university.

This paper explores teachers’ perceptions around the potential for, and enactment of LCNC in our education system. Workshops, surveys, and interviews were conducted with in-service teachers. Teachers are open to improving their digital skills. Nevertheless, some teachers fear technology and are reluctant to embrace change. Our results indicate that it is timely to leverage the increased use of technologies in the classroom before teaching reverts to pre-pandemic norms of “face-to-face.” CD provides an excellent opportunity to introduce teachers and students to aspects of computer science without placing demands on them to develop technical skills. The paper provides considerations for the adoption of CD in our education system and in initial teacher education programs. © 2023 The Author(s).

While LCDPs facilitate rapid application development by democratising application development platforms to non-professional developers (“citizen developers”), these organisations are challenged to establish strategic conformance with Low-Code applications regarding interoperability, scalability, security, and vendor lock-in. Since these LCDP challenges relate to the organisation’s enterprise strategy, the organisations should implement mitigations at the strategic level where Enterprise Architecture frameworks play an important role. This paper investigates how the LCDP challenges can be managed with the “Adaptive Integrated Digital Architecture Framework (AIDAF) with Design Thinking Approach.” A case project in a GPE verified that the AIDAF with Design Thinking Approach successfully supported managing a Low-Code application project and achieved strategic conformance with the developed Low-Code application. In addition, challenges and future issues for this research area are presented. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","","Interoperability; Architecture frameworks; Code development; Design thinking; Development platform; Digital architecture; Enterprise Architecture; High agility; Pharmaceutical enterprise; Risks management; Strategic risks; Risk management","","","","","Mangalaraj G., Nerur S., Dwivedi R., Digital transformation for agility and resilience: an exploratory study, J.

It focuses on young ethnic minorities in a subtractive language context in Vietnam and how they construct their individual language policy through their language practices, beliefs and management in responding to language policies of the family and community of which they are members. Ethnographic interviews with college-age students were the main data sources. Findings suggest that the youth’s L1-oriented individual language policy was strongly informed by their family and ethnic community’s (in)visible language policies, peer culture and the culture of respect, as well as the broader local and mainstream social settings. The youth’s individual language policy reflected their awareness of family and community desires for them to speak the ethnic language and nurture positive L1 attitudes tying to their family-community citizenship. Developing young people’s sense of family-community citizenship through language, as well as building family–community partnership for conserving a common L1-priority policy among members, may be potential grassroots initiatives which can help effectuate minority language maintenance efforts. © 2024 The Author(s).

Vaccinations were developed and introduced to control viral transmission. In the Dutch context, the decision to accept vaccination is not mandatory. An informed decision is based on sufficient and reliable information, in line with one's attitudes and values, and with consideration of pros and cons. To support people in informed decision-making, we developed an online COVID-19 vaccination decision aid (DA). Objective: This article aims to describe the development, dissemination, and use of the DA. Methods: Building on a previously developed DA, the COVID-19 vaccination DA was developed in 3 phases following a user-centered design approach: (1) definition phase, (2) concept testing, and (3) prototype testing. End users, individuals with low literacy, and experts (with relevant expertise on medical, behavioral, and low literacy aspects) were involved in the iterative development, design, and testing, with their feedback forming the basis for adaptations to the DA. Results: The DA was developed within 14 weeks. The DA consists of 3 modules, namely, Provide Information, Support Decision-Making, and Facilitate Actions Following a Decision. These modules are translated into various information tiles and diverse functionalities such as a knowledge test, a value clarification tool using a decisional balance, and a communication tool. The DA was disseminated for use in May 2021. Users varied greatly regarding age, gender, and location in the Netherlands. Conclusions: This paper elaborates on the development of the COVID-19 vaccination DA in a brief period and its dissemination for use among Dutch adults in the Netherlands. The evaluation of use showed that we were able to reach a large proportion and variety of people throughout the Netherlands. © 2024 JMIR Publications Inc..

Drawing on the peacebuilding and war recurrence literature, I contribute to this debate by theorizing reasons that newly independent states emerging from partition are likely to suffer from new conflicts between former pro-independence allies. At the domestic level, former pro-independence groups, assumed to be a unitary actor by partition proponents, are likely to fragment as their unity was based on achieving the goal of independence. Furthermore, newly independent states tend to suffer from very weak institutions, and citizens develop strong frustrations toward their new states because their unrealistically high expectations are unmet. At the international level, international peacebuilders tend to wrongly assume that the unity within the pro-independence camp will last after independence and that the pro-independence people are essentially “good guys.” As a result, they often misunderstand the post-conflict political dynamics of new states, which reduces the effectiveness of their peacebuilding efforts. My arguments are illustrated through analyzing why Timor-Leste and South Sudan, the closest to typical partition cases in the twenty-first century, faced the 2006 Crisis and the 2013 Civil War, respectively. © The Author(s) (2024).","partition; peacebuilding; secession; South Sudan; Timor-Leste","","","","","","Atlas Pierre M., Licklider Roy, Conflict among Former Allies after Civil War Settlement: Sudan, Zimbabwe, Chad, and Lebanon, Journal of Peace Research, 36, 1, pp. 35-54, (1999); Final Report of the African Union Commission of Inquiry on South Sudan, (2014); Autesserre Severine, The Trouble with the Congo, (2010); Autesserre Severine, Peaceland: Conflict Resolution and the Everyday Politics of International Intervention, (2014); Babo-Soares Dionisio, Conflict and Violence in Post-Independence East Timor, The Peace in between: Post-War Violence and Peacebuilding, pp. 211-226, (2013); Bara Corinne, Shifting Targets: The Effect of Peacekeeping on Postwar Violence, European Journal of International Relations, 26, 4, pp. 979-1003, (2020); Barnett Michael, Finnemore Martha, Rules for the World: International Organizations in Global Politics, (2004); Berdal Mats, Reflections on Post-War Violence and Peacebuilding, The Peace in between: Post-War Violence and Peacebuilding, pp. 309-326, (2013); Berg Louis-Alexandre, Civil–Military Relations and Civil War Recurrence: Security Forces in Postwar Politics, Journal of Conflict Resolution, 64, 7–8, pp. 1307-1334, (2020); Bowles Edith, Chopra Tanja, East Timor: Statebuilding Revisited, Building States to Build Peace, pp. 271-302, (2008); Boyle Michael J., Violence after War: Explaining Instability in Post-Conflict States, (2014); Brady Cynthia, Timberman David G., The Crisis in Timor-Leste: Causes, Consequences and Options for Conflict Management and Mitigation, (2006); Brancati Dawn, Snyder Jack L., Time to Kill: The Impact of Election Timing on Postconflict Stability, Journal of Conflict Resolution, 57, 5, pp. 822-853, (2013); Brosche Johan, Hoglund Kristine, Crisis of Governance in South Sudan: Electoral Politics and Violence in the World’s Newest Nation, Journal of Modern African Studies, 54, 1, pp. 67-90, (2016); Byman Daniel L., Divided They Stand Lessons about Partition from Iraq and Lebanon, Security Studies, 7, 1, pp. 1-29, (1997); Caplan Richard, Measuring Peace: Principles, Practices, and Politics, (2019); Caspersen Nina, Democracy, Nationalism and (Lack of) Sovereignty: The Complex Dynamics of Democratisation in Unrecognised States, Nations and Nationalism, 17, 2, pp. 337-356, (2011); Caspersen Nina, Unrecognised States: The Struggle for Sovereignty in the Modern International System, (2012); Chega!

Research purpose: This research investigates the impact of public service motivation on job satisfaction, organisational commitment, work engagement and counterproductive work behaviour. Motivation for the study: Counterproductive work behaviour of public service employees results in the citizenry developing negative perceptions about the government. Notwithstanding, the behaviour and attitudes of public service employees and the motivation that drives them are less explicit. Research approach/design and method: A positivist correlational research approach was implemented by administering a questionnaire to a sample of 1031 public service employees in the North West Province using a simple stratified sampling method. Statistical analyses included structural and regression modelling. Main findings: Results reveal that public service motivation statistically significantly predicts job satisfaction, organisational commitment and work engagement. The results show that 28.9% of the variance in counterproductive work behaviour could be attributed to public service motivation. Thus, as public service motivation increases, counterproductive work behaviour decreases. Practical or managerial implications: Strategies to improve public service motivation could putatively have an impact on the reduction of counterproductive work behaviour. Public service motivation could also improve service delivery to the citizenry by significantly impacting the public service employees’ work engagement. Contribution/value-add: Empirical evidence shows the influence of public service motivation on core work evaluation and counterproductive work behaviour, contributing to the corpus of knowledge with practical applicability. © 2023.

One factor that is often seen as contributing to this growing trend are social media, particularly Facebook. However, so far, research that examines the relation between social media use and affective polarization is still scarce, and the studies that exist are inconclusive and often focus on two-party systems. Using data from a panel survey conducted around the 2019 elections in Flanders, this study sets out to investigate to what extent Facebook (news) use relates to affective polarization, specifically in the context of a multi-party system. We find evidence that Facebook news use is indeed associated with higher levels of affective polarization and that citizens who rely on Facebook for their news consumption become more affectively polarized over the span of an electoral campaign than those who relied on other media channels. Moreover, we demonstrate that this relationship exists because Facebook news relates both to increased positive feelings toward the in-group, and increased hostile feelings toward the out-group, although the latter to a lesser extent. © Springer Nature Limited 2024.","Affective polarization; Echo chambers; Facebook; Social media; Survey research","","","","","","Aiello L.M., Barrat A., Schifanella R., Cattuto C., Markines B., Menczer F., Friendship Prediction and Homophily in Social Media, ACM Transactions on the Web, 6, 2, pp. 9-33, (2012); Allcott H., Braghieri L., Eichmeyer S., Gentzkow M., The Welfare Effects of Social Media, American Economic Review, 110, 3, pp. 629-676, (2020); Auter Z.J., Fine J.A., Negative Campaigning in the Social Media Age: Attack Advertising on Facebook, Political Behavior, 38, 4, pp. 999-1020, (2016); Bakshy E., Messing S., Adamic L.A., Exposure to Ideologically Diverse News and Opinion on Facebook, Science, 348, 6239, pp. 1130-1132, (2015); Banda K.K., Cluverius J., Elite Polarization, Party Extremity, and Affective Polarization, Electoral Studies, 56, pp. 90-101, (2018); Beam M.A., Hutchens M.J., Hmielowski J.D., Facebook News and (de)polarization: Reinforcing Spirals in the 2016 US Election, Information, Communication and Society, 21, 7, pp. 940-958, (2018); Buyens W., Van Aelst P., Alternative Media, Alternative Voices?

The platform leverages both regional and individual data to underpin the development of smart services on a broad scale. In particular, it advances environmental monitoring and carbon footprint reduction initiatives in accordance with the framework outlined in this paper. By integrating sensor networks and open data sources, the LCNC platform supports the development of personalised smart services, enabling citizens to actively engage in monitoring and visualising their environmental impact. The framework facilitates community collaboration and co-creation, empowering individual citizens and local communities to not only participate in the ideation and development of these services but also to individualise and continuously improve the services by adding new features and contributing data via personal devices such as smart meters and smartphones. The democratisation of technology use is designed to encourage sustainable behavioural changes and to improve the overall quality of life in smart regions. We illustrate the application of this framework through a use case on energy CO2 footprint reduction, demonstrating how co-creative processes can enhance community engagement and accelerate the implementation of sustainability transformations in urban settings. © 2024 Owner/Author.","Co-creation; Smart services; Sustainability","Carbon sequestration; Environmental monitoring; Zero-carbon; Carbon footprint reductions; Co-creation; Conceptual frameworks; Data-source; Environmental Monitoring; Integrating sensors; Passive users; Sensors network; Service managers; Smart services; Carbon capture and utilization","","","","","Akizu O., Bueno G., Barcena I., Kurt E., Topaloglu N., Lopez-Guede J., Contributions of Bottom-Up Energy Transitions in Germany: A Case Study Analysis, Energies, 11, 4, (2018); Bacco M., Delmastro F., Ferro E., Gotta A., Environmental Monitoring for Smart Cities, IEEE Sensors Journal, 17, 23, pp. 7767-7774, (2017); Brown T., Design Thinking; Cantu D., Selloni D., From engaging to empowering people: a set of co-design experiments with a service design perspective, (2013); Coulson S., Woods M., Scott M., Hemment D., Balestrini M., Stop the Noise!

As organizations face a shortage of skilled software developers, this study addresses the urgent need to leverage citizen developers – individuals without traditional technical backgrounds who can effectively contribute to software solutions using LC/NC platforms. Through a multi-layered research methodology that includes a literature review, analysis of job postings, and qualitative interviews, this paper provides a detailed characterization of the citizen developer role and delineates the specific skills and competencies necessary for success. The findings reveal that citizen developers typically occupy supplementary roles within organizations, highlighting the need for versatile, cross-functional skill sets that meet the evolving demands of modern businesses. To address this landscape, the study proposes a comprehensive framework designed to facilitate the integration of citizen developers into organizational IT strategies. This framework underscores the importance of aligning of re- and upskilling initiatives with organizational goals while fostering a culture of continuous learning. By doing so, this paper contributes to the discourse on evolving IT roles and socio-technical systems development. It offers a strategic roadmap for harnessing the potential of citizen developers to mitigate the developer shortage and enhance organizational agility in software development. © Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature 2024.","Citizen developer; Digital transformation; Information technology; Low code/no code platforms; Re- and upskilling; Software development","","","","","","Avishahar-Zeira A., Lorenz D.H.; Beer M., Spector B., Lawrence P.R., Mills D.Q., Walton R.E., A conceptual view of HRM in managing human assets, (1984); Berman S., Marshall A., The next digital transformation: from an individual-centered to an everyone-to-everyone economy, Strateg Leadersh, 42, 5, pp. 9-17, (2014); Binzer B., Winkler T.J., Low-coders, no-coders, and citizen developers in demand: Examining knowledge, skills, and abilities through a job market analysis, Wirtschaftsinformatik 2023 Proceedings, (2023); Binzer B., Elshan E., Furstenau D., Winkler T.J., Establishing a low-code/no-code-enabled citizen development strategy, MIS Q Exec, 23, 3, pp. 253-273, (2024); Binzer B., Winkler T.J., Democratizing software development: A systematic multivocal literature review and research agenda on citizen development, Software Business: 13th International Conference, ICSOB 2022, Bolzano, Italy, November 8–11, 2022, Proceedings, pp. 244-259, (2022); ) Rekord-Fachkräftemangel, Bitkom, (2023); Bolmsten J., Dittrich Y., Infrastructuring when you don’t – End-user development and organizational infrastructure, End-user development, pp. 139-154, (2011); Bughin J., Hazan E., Lund S., Dahlstrom P., Wiesinger A., Subramaniam A., Skill Shift: Automation and the Future of the Workforce., (2018); Carroll N., Maher M., How shell fueled digital transformation by establishing DIY software development, MIS Quart Execut, 22, 2, pp. 99-127, (2023); Cegielski C.G., Jones-Farmer L.A., Knowledge, skills, and abilities for entry-level business analytics positions: a multi-method study, Decis Sci J Innov Educ, 14, 1, pp. 91-118, (2016); Charmaz K., Constructing grounded theory: A practical guide through qualitative analysis, (2006); Costabile M.F., de Ruyter B., Mehandjiev N., Mussio P., End-user development of software services and applications, Proceedings of the International Conference on Advanced Visual Interfaces., pp. 403-407, (2010); Davenport T.H., Kirby J., Only Humans Need Apply: Winners and Losers in the Age of Smart Machines, (2016); Davenport T.H., Patil D.J., Data scientist, Harv Bus Rev, 90, 5, pp. 70-76, (2012); Davies A., Fidler D., Gorbis M., Future Work Skills 2020., (2011); Debortoli S., Muller O., Junglas I., vom Brocke J., Text mining for information systems researchers: an annotated topic modeling tutorial, Commun Assoc Inf Syst, 39, pp. 110-135, (2016); Denzin N.K., Triangulation 2.0, J Mixed Meth Res, 6, 2, pp. 80-88, (2017); Defining the skills citizens will need in the future world of work., (2021); Elsafty A., Elzeftawy A., Towards effective mitigation of the digital transformation and COVID-19 risk on unemployment in mobile operators in Egypt, Int J Bus Manag, 17, 2, (2022); Elshan E., Dickhaut E., Ebel P., An investigation of why low code platforms provide answers and new challenges, In: Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, pp. 6159-6168, (2023); Definition of Citizen Developer, (2022); Gomes P.M., Brito M.A., Low-code development platforms: A descriptive study, 17Th Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies, Madrid.

Alarms raised over widening civic knowledge gaps have prompted a renewed commitment to building more civically literate, active citizens. Like their counterparts in schools and universities, librarians teach many of the skills and dispositions that citizens need to participate in civic life. Yet their information literacy frameworks equip twenty-first century learners primarily for success in college and career, not citizenship. With schools and colleges launching new initiatives to bolster civic participation, librarians must join forces with other civic literacy proponents to empower citizens to emerge as civic agents that cocreate their future together. While the nation’s great experiment in democracy undergoes a momentous test, libraries must assert their role in fos-tering civic literacy as central to their mission as cornerstones of democracy. © 2024 The University of Chicago.","","","","","","","2023. “VALUE Rubrics—Civic Engagement; American Association of State Colleges and Universities). 2023. “American Democracy Project; Abernathy P., The State of Local News: The 2022 Report.” Local News Initiative, (2022); Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education, (2016); Jane A., 2002.

One primary limitation defining the present scholarship on CCR is the authentic analysis of the on the ground or field practices high schools perform to increase learners’ CCR competencies. The inadequate research on actual CCR practices in high schools motivated this study. To learn more about how high schools prepare students for post-secondary life, 16 principals from high schools provided detailed narratives on CCR practices in their institutions. Principals completed interviews of one to two hours using Microsoft Teams, supplying the researcher with specific information and examples of how their institutions equip students for future careers and higher education. Manual qualitative thematic analysis of the entire transcript guided the organization and interpretation of the findings, allowing the presentation of meaningful themes supported by a plethora of illustrations. Six themes representing 18 distinct CCR practices emerged, and the themes were rigorous curriculum, content knowledge, key academic behaviors, key cognitive strategies, multiculturalism, and citizenship development. Results partially supported the pervasive CCR model based on Conley’s readiness index. Increasingly, diversity and citizenship learning have defined high schools’ CCR work in preparing learners to become effective local and global citizens. The current investigation paves the way for future observational and field research uncovering whether schools truly prepare students or not, and such preparation varies across community, country, and institutional characteristics. © 2024 by the author.","career and college readiness; citizenship development; multiculturalism; thematic analysis; urban high schools","","","","","","Conley D.T., A Complete Definition of College and Career Readiness, (2012); Alabdulkarem A., Alhojailan M., Alabdulkarim S., Comprehensive investigation of factors influencing university students’ academic performance in Saudi Arabia, Educ.

They can alsohelp bridge the gap between IT and business teams, allowing for more collaboration and better alignmentof technology with business goals. Overall, citizen developer teams are a way for organizations to tap into the collective knowledge andexpertise of their employees, empower them to drive digital transformation and improve business processes. This presentation aims to illustrate the importance of having such hybrid teams in any organization.By empowering non-technical employees to create custom software solutions, organizations can access adiverse range of knowledge and expertise to meet the needs of all stakeholders. DataGMA exemplifiesthis approach, having successfully improved data-driven processes at YPF Upstream NOC through thedevelopment and implementation of short-term Digital Solutions. By utilizing microservice principles andagile methodologies, DataGMA has made a significant impact on the organization, fostering a culture ofdata-driven decision making and improving various business processes. Specifically, DataGMA is a YPF Upstream NOC multidisciplinary team that combines geoscientists withtechnical support to deliver short-term solutions using Python and Low Code Platforms. While IT manages main and corporate applications according to corporate priorities and scope, DataGMAcan take on new challenges and provide targeted solutions for short-term needs. Historical data was officially safeguarded and made available through new workflows, via optimizedformats. Many manual tasks were replaced by automatic processes and many Python applicationswere created to optimize the interpretations of physical phenomena, with minimal cost. Finally, workmethodologies and reporting of various disciplines were optimized through a combination of dashboardsand low code application building. Throughout 3 years, DataGMA has improved many business processes by tackling non-governed dataand building data awareness. This has radically improved engagement around the data life cycle and reducedtime of no valuable work, such as repetitive or inefficient tasks. With a dynamic approach, the team wasable to solve, not only recurrent business problems but new challenging ones, which has helped with digital transformation transition. DataGMA is an example of how a group of citizen Developers, included in a teamwith access to digital technologies, can achieve a direct impact on business performance. © 2023 Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE).

Apart from other issues, this inherent complexity often gives room for implementation errors, which can be in many cases fatal and drive the application and/or the system to undesired states. The current work aspires to alleviate this problem by introducing a low-code approach for building IoT and CPS applications. We argue that, through the proposed approach it is possible to lower development time and risk (errors/bug-related ones) and allow a wide range of end-users to build and monitor applications for state-of-the-art domains, such as smart home and smart industry. In this context, Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) approaches are explored and SmAuto, a Domain-specific Language (DSL) is proposed for creating and executing automation tasks for smart environments. Through SmAuto it is possible to handle the heterogeneity and complexity issues of the IoT and CPS domains, this way allowing end-users are non-technical application experts to build well-designed and properly functioning smart applications. The proposed DSL implements a Sense-Think-Act-Communicate model for smart environments and enables the creation, validation, and dynamic execution of composite automation models in physical, virtual and hybrid environments, while it also enables automated code generation of virtual entities for verification purposes. By using layered abstractions to automate the development process, end-users can concentrate on the real problem instead of dwelling into technical details, thus increasing their productivity. The results of the empirical evaluation and the comparison to existing approaches show that SmAuto can make application development more rigorous, improves productivity of end-users including non-experts, i.e. citizen developers and satisfies several functional and non-functional requirements of modern DSLs, such as tool support, modular deployment, reusability, availability and extensibility. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Cyber-physical systems; Domain-specific languages; Internet-of-Things; Model-driven Engineering; Rapid application development; Smart environments","Automation; Complex networks; Digital subscriber lines; Embedded systems; Internet of things; Problem oriented languages; Reusability; Application development; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Domains specific languages; End-users; Model-driven Engineering; Multiple layers; Rapid application development; Smart environment; System applications; Cyber Physical System","","","","","Li S., Xu L.D., Zhao S., The internet of things: a survey, Inf.

In recent years, this has begun to change, with new pathways to permanent residency and citizenship developing in the region. This paper takes a comparative case study approach to analyzing the policy changes in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, and then explores the implications thereof. Broadening the pathways for permanent residency and citizenship offers opportunities (e.g., reversing financial outflows, increasing domestic investment and savings, attracting foreign direct investment and skilled talent) while it also presents risks (e.g., contesting traditional forms of belonging and entitlement, reducing social cohesion, and creating new forms of inequalities). While new pathways have indeed emerged, these pathways are designed for specific types of people, defined by the criteria or requirements of them. The unique policies of the three countries imply unique directions for the economies, demographic transitions, and socio-political cultures of the region. © The Author(s) 2024.","Citizenship; Middle East;

Much of the resulting scholarship has focused on the international to the exclusion of the national. This article addresses this relative neglect by focusing on a particular iteration of Third World nation-state-building: co-operative socialism in Forbes Burnham's Guyana. Refuting the argument that co-operative socialism was imitative and implemented for reasons of political expediency only, the article contends that Burnham's doctrine should be regarded as a meaningful attempt at remaking Guyana's society and economy through its core principles of self-sufficiency, self-reliance, and self-discipline. These principles gave rise to a specific conception of citizenship in 1970s Guyana, where the People's National Congress (PNC) sought to link political belonging and participation with a moral ethic premised on the notion of hard work in service of the nation. The article examines how this collectivist understanding of citizenship gave rise to a particular set of struggles at the turn of the 1980s, as the co-operative republic began to collapse. What emerged from these struggles was an alternate but parallel imagining of citizenship espoused by the Working People's Alliance (WPA), which rejected the PNC's vanguardism in favour of empowering the Guyanese people through the creation of non-hierarchical systems of collective authority. The article concludes by arguing that the failure of the WPA's attempt to overthrow the PNC through popular revolt signified the ends of decolonization and Third Worldism in the Caribbean, and the beginnings of new struggles against new forms of coloniality in the guise of the emerging neoliberal and good governance agendas.

Why can’t we build our own roads, process our own food, and mine our own minerals, oil, and gas? Why don’t we have world-class hospitals and industries? How can we have so much natural wealth and yet be so poor? Why do we invent so little?” The answer lies in our failure to implement idea number two. There are two major ideas in educational policy. Idea number one is the obligation to educate all children because it is their fundamental human right as enshrined in the 1948 United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. Idea number two is the strategy of establishing and sustaining world class schools and universities for the education of the most highly gifted and highly talented citizens. Developed countries deploy both ideas aggressively. Underdeveloped countries in Africa have not implemented idea number two. Countries that have deployed idea number two have at least one university ranked among the top 200 in the world. The presence of great universities (top 200) in a country is a 21st century indicator of the presence of high levels of innovation, technology, development and wealth in that country. According to the three major rankings of world universities (Shanghai-ARWU, THE, and QS-topuniversities.com), none of the world’s top 100 great universities is in Africa. Although Africa was a pioneer among the continents in innovations such as human language, domestication of fire, making of tools, invention of agriculture, development of writing, and creation of great centers of learning in ancient times, it has fallen behind other continents over the last 500 years and it has been disrupted by enslavement and colonization, and the structural adjustment programs (SAPs) of the IMF and the World Bank. Ancient African centers of innovation included the Ancient City of Benin and Timbuktu in Western Africa, the Kingdom of Kush and ancient Egypt in northern Africa, Axum in Eastern Africa, Mapungubwe and Great Zimbabwe in Southern Africa, and the Kingdom of Kongo in central-Africa. An African renaissance will only occur when we implement idea number two by establishing world class schools and at least one great university per African country. © 2024, Women's Health and Action Research Centre.

Having a clear enterprise architecture supports organizations choose the right technology, integrate new technologies, and capture latent values. This study applies the enterprise architecture framework TOGAF when designing and implementing two baseline service-oriented architectures for Maxon, a Swiss manufacturer of precision drives. The first use case aims to improve quality management. It describes an architecture for data analytics using Microsoft Azure cloud services, which exports the working dataset from a local SQL database to a cloud-based SQL server to further process the data. The second use case aims to improve warehouse logistics processes. It proposes the introduction of citizen development where non-IT employees developed a warehouse logistics application for smartphones. This study demonstrates how companies can leverage enterprise architecture to improve business operations. More specifically, this paper shows how service-oriented architecture in a well-designed enterprise architecture enables use case development and scaling. Considering the trend towards (cloud) service adoption, this paper provides useful guidelines for the transformation. It presents a structured approach to design an enterprise architecture that aligns transformation efforts within the organization. © 2023, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Cloud Technology; Enterprise Architecture; Service-oriented Architecture; Use Case Approach","Cloud analytics; Computer architecture; Data Analytics; Data warehouses; Digital storage; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Warehouses; Windows operating system; Architecture frameworks; Case-studies; Cloud services; Cloud technologies; Digital technologies; Digital transformation; Enterprise Architecture; Latent value; Soa (serviceoriented architecture); Use case approaches; Information services","","","","","Fitzgerald M., Kruschwitz N., Bonnet D., Welch M., Embracing digital technology: A new strategic imperative, MIT Sloan Manag.

In response, numerous cities are making efforts to adopt new information technologies to become more efficient and transform themselves into smart cities. A large body of research has underlined that the success of these smart city initiatives depends on putting citizens at the center of the design process. In contrast to the techno-centric view applied in the past, citizen-centric approaches focus on prioritizing the needs of citizens over technology and aim at involving them directly in the development of smart city services. In this article, we describe this involvement as citizen development by introducing a model-based architecture that enables citizens to develop smart city services in a low-code fashion. Consequently, we focus on citizen developers, a group of citizens engaged with the technological development of services. Furthermore, the conceptualization of a citizen development architecture is discussed, as well as the ways citizens can interact with it. An important pillar in this approach are citizen workshops, which aim at stimulating innovative ideas and collaboration among stakeholders by using design thinking methodology. Our approach empowers citizens to become active producers within the smart city ecosystem, leading to more inclusive and citizen-centric smart cities.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","citizen development; Citizen-centricity; conceptual modeling; smart city","Design; Population statistics; Citizen development; Citizen-centricity; Citizens workshops; Conceptual model; Consumables; Design thinking; Design-process; Innovative ideas; Model-based OPC; Technological development; Smart city","","","","","Aguilera U., Pena O., Belmonte O., De Ipina D.L., Citizen-centric data services for smarter cities, Future Generation Computer Systems, 76, 1, pp. 234-247, (2017); Ahlgren B., Hidell M., Ngai E.C.-H., Internet of things for smart cities: Interoperability and open data, IEEE Internet Computing, 20, 6, pp. 52-56, (2016); Archpru Akaka M., Vargo S.L., Extending the context of service: From encounters to ecosystems, Journal of Services Marketing, 29, 6-7, pp. 453-462, (2015); Anthopoulos L.G., The Smart City in Practice, pp. 47-185, (2017); Axelsson K., Granath M., Stakeholders' stake and relation to smartness in smart city development: Insights from a Swedish city planning project, Government Information Quarterly, 35, 4, pp. 693-702, (2018); Badii C., Bellini P., Cenni D., Difino A., Nesi P., Paolucci M., Analysis and assessment of a knowledge based smart city architecture providing service APIs, Future Generation Computer Systems, 75, pp. 14-29, (2017); Balestrini M., Rogers Y., Hassan C., Creus J., King M., Marshall P., A city in common: A framework to orchestrate large-scale citizen engagement around urban issues, Proceedings of the 2017 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI'17 Denver, Colorado, USA), pp. 2282-2294, (2017); Batista E., Angels Moncusi M., Lopez-Aguilar P., Martinez-Balleste A., Solanas A., Sensors for context-aware smart healthcare: A security perspective, Sensors, 21, 20, (2021); Batty M., Axhausen K.W., Giannotti F., Pozdnoukhov A., Bazzani A., Wachowicz M., Ouzounis G., Portugali Y., Smart cities of the future, The European Physical Journal Special Topics, 214, 1, pp. 481-518, (2012); Beverungen D., Muller O., Matzner M., Medling J., Vom Brocke J., Conceptualizing smart service systems, Electronic Markets, 29, 1, pp. 7-18, (2019); Biloria N., From smart to empathic cities, Frontiers of Architectural Research, 10, 1, pp. 3-16, (2021); Boudreau K.J., Hagiu A., Chapter 7: Platform Rules: Multi-Sided Platforms as Regulators, pp. 163-191, (2009); Boukhris I., Ayachi R., Elouedi Z., Mellouli S., Ben Amor N., Decision model for policy makers in the context of citizens engagement: Application on participatory budgeting, Social Science Computer Review, 34, 6, pp. 740-756, (2016); Brown T., Design thinking, Harvard Business Review, 2008, pp. 84-92, (2008); Brown T., Katz B., Change by design, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 28, 3, pp. 381-383, (2011); Camero A., Alba E., Smart city and information technology: A review, Cities, 93, 1, pp. 84-94, (2019); Cardullo P., Kitchin R., Being a ""citizen"" in the smart city: Up and down the scaffold of smart citizen participation in Dublin, Ireland, GeoJournal, 84, 1, pp. 1-13, (2019); Carroll L.S.L., A comprehensive definition of technology from an ethological perspective, Social Sciences, 6, 4, pp. 1-20, (2017); Cerny T., Donahoo M.J., Trnka M., Contextual understanding of microservice architecture: Current and future directions, SIGAPP Applied Computing Review, 17, 4, pp. 29-45, (2018); Chen Z., Cheng Chu Chan I., Smart cities and quality of life: A quantitative analysis of citizens' support for smart city development, Information Technology and People, 36, 1, pp. 263-285, (2022); Cocchia A., Smart and digital city: A systematic literature review, Proceedings of the Smart City: How to Create Public and Economic Value with High Technology in Urban Space, pp. 13-43, (2014); Cortes-Cediel M.E., Cantador I., Pedro Rodriguez Bolivar M., Analyzing citizen participation and engagement in european smart cities, Social Science Computer Review, 39, 4, pp. 592-626, (2021); Ramon Gil-Garcia J., Pardo T.A., Nam T., What makes a city smart?

Low-code has shown potential to support digitalization in different business scenarios. Nevertheless, there is a lack of scientific literature exploring how this technology could be leveraged in the construction industry. This paper addresses this gap using case study research to analyze the development and implementation of a novel low-code application to monitor production in tunneling construction. The outcomes reveal that the involvement of people closer to operation in the low-code development process supports productive development practices enabling the delivery of an application meeting project requirements and supporting on-site adoption. The introduction of the application resulted in an increase in productivity during the reporting process. The innovative use of low-code technology in the construction industry also reveals opportunities for future research. © 2024 ISARC.

LCDPs typically run on the cloud with zero-cost installation and often use graphical languages to describe the target applications. While building LCDPs manually is costly, the process can benefit from the automation that model-driven technologies offer. To this end, we propose Dandelion, a cloud-based graphical-language workbench specifically designed to create LCDPs. Dandelion supports the definition of the abstract and concrete syntax of graphical languages, resulting in tailored cloud-based modelling environments. To cater for industrial needs, the tool can be connected with heterogeneous modelling technologies - including proprietary formats or standards like EMF - and can handle large models via persistence in Elasticsearch and a model pagination mechanism. To facilitate modelling by citizen developers, it features sensemaking strategies to ease understanding (meta-)models via interactive graphics and diagrams; and flexible modelling support to relax the meta-model/model conformance relation, thus tolerating inconsistencies.

To contribute to the support and assistance needed by the elderly who are called senior citizens, this study was conducted. This aims to develop and design a usable, performance-efficient, and functional suitable to the operation and service of the Office of the Senior Citizen Affairs (OSCA), Cabanatuan City office. The System Application Office of the Senior Citizen Affairs Information Management System with Analytics (OSCA-IMSA) was developed using the Agile System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Model. The agile model has different phases and sub-phases that guarantee the quality and efficient development of the system. Every phase and sub-phases lead to a well-organized, and systematic process of system development. The proponents adopted the ISO/IEC 25010 criteria as an evaluation tool to assess the system's usability, reliability, performance efficiency, functional suitability, security, portability, maintainability, and compatibility. The self-made survey questionnaire was used as the main tool to collect the data from the respondents. Purposive sampling was used to determine the right respondents for the study. The study was composed of two different sets of respondents, the first set was the System Users and the second set was composed of IT Experts. The Office of the Senior Citizen Affairs Information Management System with Analytics (OSCA-IMSA) was evaluated and assessed by the respondents with a result of being highly functional, highly efficient, highly portable, highly maintainable, highly compatible, highly secured, highly reliable, and highly usable. This result indicates that the system passed and conformed to the ISO/IEC 25010 Software Product Quality Standard, hence, is recommended to be deployed at the research locale. © 2023, Intellectual Research and Development Education Foundation (YRPI).

Most existing accounts of citizens’ liabilities for state-perpetrated injustices, whilst applicable across certain democratic contexts, struggle to provide robust accounts of the grounds and nature of liabilities for citizens in non-democratic contexts. This problematically leaves a lacuna when it comes to the responsibilities and appropriate responses of citizens in these states. This article advances a distinctive two-pronged authorisation-based account applicable to non-democracies. Objective authorisers are individuals who derive presumptive benefits, are comparably better-off under, and can reliably influence the decision-making processes over the injustice perpetrated by the state. Subjective authorisers are citizens who autonomously endorse their state as credible interpreters and upholders of their aims in relation to the injustices in question. Both objective and subjective authorisers of the state in relation to particular injustices perpetrated, are liable to compensate, actively oppose, and commemorate the victims of state-perpetrated injustices. This account will be shown to be empirically applicable to a large number of minimally decent non-democratic states, where the political elite enjoy moderate popular support over their incorporation and reflection of citizen interests and preferences in their governance, despite the absence of formal democratic electoral mechanisms. This authorisation-based view differs from existing accounts oriented around complicity and participatory intentions, in better accounting for non-participants who are nevertheless intuitively liable for the actions of their authorised state, as well as circumventing structural shortcomings affecting complicity-centric accounts. © 2024 The Author(s).

However, the lack of familiarity with the implementation and application of LCDPs in organizations poses a challenge. This publication therefore aims to shed light on the essential organizational capabilities that companies must master to overcome this obstacle. Using action design research, this study develops a model-based framework of 21 organizational capabilities for successful LCDP adoption. It underscores the importance of conceptual development as a prerequisite for effective management and long-term application of the technology. Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance of considering both technical and social aspects of the LCDP information system. The findings contribute to academia by providing a model-based capability framework, which serves as a structure for driving future research. Moreover, practitioners benefit from a practice-oriented and evaluated summary of initialization tasks and capabilities required for successful adoption. © 2024 IEEE Computer Society.

This enhancement can be effectively achieved by using smart service systems that focus on value co-creation among all stakeholders. In general, these services have to be engineered in a special way tailored to the particular community and use case at hand. In this paper, we propose an engineering approach centered on the concept of the citizen developer for creating, maintaining and managing those smart services. By using a domain-specific modelling language specially tailored to the smart region context, we develop a platform capable of generating smart services from a high-level description including data sources, transformations and visualizations. This results in an efficient and cost-effective development approach where the stakeholders of the smart region context themselves lead the process of building, deploying and implementing the relevant use-cases for their communities. © 2023 Owner/Author.","Citizen developer; Service-dominant logic; Smart cities; Smart regions; Smart service engineering","Cost effectiveness; Economic and social effects; High level languages; Modeling languages; Citizen developer; Economic development; Management development; Service oriented engineerings; Service systems; Service-dominant Logic; Services engineering; Smart region; Smart service engineering; Smart services; Smart city","","","","","Markkula M., Kune H., Making Smart Regions Smarter: Smart Specialization and the Role of Universities in Regional Innovation Ecosystems, Technology Innovation Management Review, 5, 10, pp. 7-15, (2015); Vandermerwe S., Rada J., Servitization of business: Adding value by adding services, European Management Journal, 6, 4, pp. 314-324, (1988); Baines T.S., Lightfoot H.W., Benedettini O., Kay J.M., The servitization of manufacturing: A review of literature and reflection on future challenges, Journal of Manufacturing Technology Management, 20, 5, pp. 547-567, (2009); Zhang J., Qi L., Crisis Preparedness of Healthcare Manufacturing Firms during the COVID-19 Outbreak: Digitalization and Servitization, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 18, 10, (2021); Lusch R.F., Vargo S.L., Wessels G., Toward a conceptual foundation for service science: Contributions from service-dominant logic, IBM Systems Journal, 47, 1, pp. 5-14, (2008); Vargo S.L., Lusch R.F., Service-dominant logic: Continuing the evolution, J. of the Acad.

This article qualitatively analysed posts on Reddit to understand how users translated their sensorial and affective experiences into contestable, subjective, and legitimate haze data. This article argues that these experiences generated alternative data in the form of ‘counterdata’ through the collective validation of individual sensorial experiences online. Importantly, these sensorial and affective experiences did not just generate more data to understand the city’s air pollution levels. These experiences revealed the social constructedness of data and data infrastructures within the context of the institutional hegemony over data and functioned as a mechanism through which the political discourse in the city-state was broadened. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","affect; air pollution; Environmental data; haze; social media","","","","","","Ahall L., Affect as Methodology: Feminism and the Politics of Emotion, International Political Sociology, 12, 1, pp. 36-52, (2018); Ahmed S., Affective Economies, Social Text, 22, 2, pp. 117-139, (2004); Ahmed S., Queer Phenomenology: Orientations, Objects, Others, (2006); Ahmed S., Orientations Matter, New Materialisms: Ontology, Agency, and Politics, 234, (2010); Ahmed S., Living a Feminist Life, (2017); Antonakaki M., French J.E., Guner C., Et al., Realising Sara Ahmed’s’ Feminist Snap’: Voices, Embodiment, Affectivity, Ephemera: Theory & Politics in Organization, 18, 4, pp. 923-954, (2018); Bellani L., Ceolotto S., Elsner B., Pestel N., The Political Fallout of Air Pollution, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 121, 18, (2024); Binder A.R., Scheufele D.A., Brossard D., Gunther A.C., Interpersonal Amplification of Risk?

The general hypothesis proposed in this research is that the problem of climate change has an influence on the high level of attention of the global community, including academics, to environmental issues related to the active role of citizens demanding environmental justice and sustainable development. This study aims to explore globally published documents to provide an in-depth discussion concerning ecological citizenship. Bibliometric analysis was employed from the Scopus database. The main findings confirm the significant contribution of ecological citizenship in shaping global understanding of the role of individuals in maintaining environmental sustainability. The research theme mapping shows the diversity of issues that have been explored, with particular emphasis on environmental education and social justice, providing a basis for recommendations for future research. In particular, environmental education has been recognized as a critical element in shaping society’s understanding of environmental issues, while social justice underscores the importance of fair distribution and critical analysis of inequality in social and ecological contexts. Future research recommendations include the exploration of effective strategies in promoting the concept of ecological citizenship, developing a holistic environmental education curriculum, and more active research in the context of social justice in various regions, including Asia. This bibliometric analysis is expected to contribute substantially to formulating policies and practical actions that support the vision of inclusive ecological citizenship, which positively impacts overcoming global environmental challenges. © 2024 by author(s).","ecological citizenship; environmental education; social justice; sustainable development","","","","","","Ahmad M., Satrovic E., Modeling natural resources for ecological sustainability, Gondwana Research, 126, pp. 243-266, (2024); Ardian Feriandi Y., Budimansyah D., Komalasari K., Developing measurement instrument of students’ citizenship ecological behavior on citizenship education course in middle school, Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment, 33, 7, pp. 954-966, (2023); Asilsoy B., Oktay D., Exploring environmental behaviour as the major determinant of ecological citizenship, Sustainable Cities and Society, 39, pp. 765-771, (2018); Binawan A.

Many African leaders have exploited their armed forces, augmenting their executive authority to strengthen their governing positions. Weak state structures and mechanisms of civil oversight have destabilised good governance and an inability to satisfy the needs of their citizens. Developing countries must consider reorienting their military budget towards domestic projects dealing with security to advance economic and social stability. Political leaders must do away with outdated security culture that deals with perceived threats at the expense of economic development projects. It would require identifying, prioritising, and implementing specific elements of good governance.

The reuse of corresponding artefacts has been researched and practiced for almost 40 years. Yet, with the growing adoption of componentand platform-based information systems, a current review of how we view and conduct reuse in Business Process Automation becomes necessary. The advent of citizen developers further increases the need for a consolidated overview of the knowledge on reuse. As citizen developers are not trained to conduct reuse, guidance on how to harness the potential of reuse is needed. Based on a literature review, we identify four main layers on which process automation artefacts are reused and list exemplary technologies and methodologies. In addition, we systematize nine characteristics of reused automation artefacts and nine characteristics that describe a concrete instance of reuse. Finally, we provide a research agenda. © 2023 Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI).

This popularity arises from the fact that low-code platforms on one hand speed up the application development process and on the other hand they make the application development accessible for business users without deep expertise in information technologies, i.e. for so-called citizen developers. At the same time, there is a widely spread opinion that low-code platforms can only be used for simple applications, consisting often in only single process automation. There is a strong belief that there is a necessary trade off between simplicity and complexity - a platform simple to use cannot be used to automate complex systems. In this paper we discuss whether this is necessarily true. As the main cause for this claim we identify the lack of mechanisms for inter process relationships and inter-process communications in nowadays recognized low code platforms. Then, using low-code language Petriflow, we illustrate how such inter-process communication can be incorporated into low code platforms in order to serve for developing complex core enterprise applications consisting of interplay of many data objects and processes, resulting in so called applications based on object-centric processes.  © 2024 IEEE.","","Commerce; Application development; Application development process; Business process automation; Code languages; Core enterprise; Digital transformation; Enterprise applications; Interprocess communication; Simple++; Speed up; Large scale systems","","","","","Juhas G., Kovacik T., Kovar J., Kranec M., Petrovic, Petriflow language and netgrif application builder, 2973, pp. 171-175; Juhasova A., Juhas G., Molnar L., Ondrisova M., Mazari J., Mladoniczky M., It induced innovations: Digital transformation and process automation, Proc.

With these changes, a new generation of developers must be trained. Such training is considered the responsibility of higher education institutions that enthusiastically adopt practice-based and experiential learning approaches. At the core, the focus is on real-world experiences and practical problem-solving, albeit with growing concerns about limiting deep learning and metacognitive reflections. Ample educational research highlights that metacognition is essential for students to be workplace-ready, but very little research has investigated the impact of practice-based learning on metacognitive reflections. This study draws on experiential learning theory to examine the influence of experiences in a low-code systems development project on metacognitive thinking. In a quantitative study using a survey, the effects of experiential learning factors (i.e., authenticity, active learning, self-relevance, and utility) and a team-based learning factor on metacognitive reflections are tested. Results show that when citizen developers create business applications, the experiential learning factors positively impact metacognitive reflections. However, team-based learning only positively moderates the relationship between self-relevance and reflections, whereas it negatively moderates the relationship between authenticity and reflections. Taken as a whole, the study's contributions suggest that practice-based learning using low-code platforms under the citizen developer method is an effective way to train IT talents with needed context and life-long self-learning skills. © The Author(s) 2025.","Citizen development; Experiential learning; Low-code platform; Metacognitive reflections; Survey; Systems development","","","","","","Top 10: No-Code AI Platforms, (2024); Ajish D., A comprehensive review of the significance of low-code automation in risk management for banks, Int J Innov Res Comput Sci Technol, 12, 2, pp. 47-58, (2024); Alt R., Leimeister J.M., Priemuth T., Sachse S., Urbach N., Wunderlich N., Software-defined business: implications for IT management, Bus Inf Syst Eng, 62, pp. 609-621, (2020); Anderson J.C., Gerbing D.W., Structural equation modeling in practice: a review and recommended two-step approach, Psychol Bull, 103, 3, pp. 411-423, (1988); Bakir N., Humpherys S., Dana K., Students' perceptions of challenges and solutions to face-to-face and online group work, Inf Syst Educ J, 18, 5, pp. 75-88, (2020); Bandura A., Social foundations of thought and action: a social cognitive theory, (1986); Baroudi J.J., Olson M.H., Ives B., An empirical study of the impact of user involvement on system usage and information satisfaction, Commun ACM, 29, 3, pp. 232-238, (1986); Becker T.E., Atinc G., Breaugh J.A., Carlson K.D., Edwards J.R., Spector P.E., Statistical control in correlational studies: 10 essential recommendations for organizational researchers, J Organ Behav, 37, 2, pp. 157-167, (2016); Beranic T., Rek P., Hericko M., Adoption and usability of low-code/no-code development tools, In: Central European Conference on Information and Intelligent Systems, (2020); Berardi V., Kaur V., Thacker D., Blundell G., Towards a citizen development andragogy: Low-code platforms, design thinking and knowledge-based dynamic capabilities, Int J High Educ, 9, 2, (2023); Bernstein D.A., Does active learning work?

Business logic is implemented in multiple technologies and developed decentrally across the organization. Especially citizen developers, who do not have extensive programming knowledge, face issues regarding reuse. Based on a thorough literature analysis and informed by Transaction Cost Theory, this research in progress identifies five challenges for reuse. Following design science research, we develop five principles that help organizations set up reuse environments that encompass both low-code and traditional development regarding automation artifacts. In addition, we describe how we plan to validate the principles in the next stage of our research. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Citizen Developer; Design Science; Low-Code; Process Automation; Reuse; Technological Rule","Business logic; Business Process; Citizen developer; Design science; Low-code; Organisational; Process automation; Reuse; Reuse process; Technological rule; Reamers","","","","","Dumas M., la Rosa M., Mendling J., Et al., (2018) Fundamentals of Business Process Management, (2018); Woo M., The rise of no/low code software development—no experience needed?, Engineering, 6, (2020); Novales A., Mancha R., Fueling digital transformation with citizen developers and low-code development, MISQ Exec, 22, (2023); Apte U., Sankar C.S., Thakur M., Et al., Reusability-based strategy for development of information systems: Implementation experience of a bank, MISQ, 14, (1990); Allen G., Parsons J., Is query reuse potentially harmful? anchoring and adjustment in adapting existing database queries, Inf.

This study explores whether LCDPs can fulfill their promise of empowering “citizen developers” (CDs) without extensive programming experience. Our paper involves a two-part empirical study. First, we conducted semi-structured interviews with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to understand their acceptance of LCDPs and identify potential barriers, such as the need for extensive training. Second, we performed a quantitative experiment to compare the performance of programmers and CDs using a prototype no-code builder. The results reveal no significant difference in task correctness or processing time between the two groups, suggesting that the training concerns for CDs may be overstated. These findings indicate that LCDPs could indeed democratize software development, allowing SMEs to develop necessary applications cost-effectively with minimal training requirements. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","citizen development; developer efficiency; Low-code development platform","Software design; Software prototyping; Application development; Citizen development; Code development; Developer efficiency; Development platform; Empirical studies; Low-code development platform; Pre-built components; Small and medium-sized enterprise; Software developer; Application programs","","","","","Auth0; MaxQDA; Alsaadi H.A., Radain D.T., Alzahrani M.M., Alshammari W.F., Alahmadi D., Fakieh B., Factors that affect the utilization of low-code development platforms: survey study, Romanian Journal of Information Technology & Automatic Control/Revista Română de Informatică s, i Automatică, (2021); Alyousef Z., Challenges Development Teams Face in Low-code Development Process, (2021); Beranic T., Rek P., Hericko M., Adoption and usability of low-code/no-code development tools, Central European Conference on Information and Intelligent Systems, pp. 97-103, (2020); Bernsteiner R., Schlogl S., Ploder C., Dilger T., Brecher F., Citizen vs. Professional Developers: Differences and Similarities of Skills and Training Requirements for Low Code Development Platforms, ICERI2022 Proceedings, pp. 4257-4264, (2022); Binzer B., Winkler T.J., Democratizing Software Development: A Systematic Multivocal Literature Review and Research Agenda on Citizen Development, Software Business – 13th International Conference, pp. 244-259, (2022); Bock A.C., Frank U., Search of the Essence of Low-Code: An Exploratory Study of Seven Development Platforms, ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems Companion, pp. 57-66, (2021); Bortz J., Schuster C., Statistik für Human-und Sozialwissenschaftler: Limitierte Sonderausgabe, (2011); Bucaioni A., Cicchetti A., Ciccozzi F., Modelling in low-code development: a multi-vocal systematic review, Softw.

Our theoretical framework is based on engagement theory, from which we derive three fundamental components (i.e. cognitive, affective, and behavioural). Data derived from explorative fieldwork and in-depth interviews with engaged citizens and public servants provide the empirical grounding. Set in Brussels, Belgium, we focus on two cases that involve green spaces earmarked for future development and have been contested by citizens who have expressed various ecological and political demands. We find that the cognitive, affective, and behavioural dimensions are fundamental to understand environmental activism. In addition, we show that personal values are relational in nature and that indignation and anger are identified as pivotal for collective action. Also internal/external efficacy is important to understand citizens’ engagement. Citizens’ motivational components exhibit a robust form of entanglement that highlights a more complex mode of city-making, a finding that may inform environmental policies. © International Society for Third-Sector Research 2024.","Emotions; Environmental activism; Knowledge; Personal values; Relational values","Belgium; Brussels [Belgium]; Brussels [Brussels (RGA)]; collective action; environmental policy; greenspace; social movement","","","","","Anbleyth-Evans J., Nanculef-Huaiquinao J., Conuecar-Llancapani Y., Araos Leiva F., Riquelme Maulen W., Raymond C., Mapuche Az-Mapu and Nature’s contribution to people: Eudemonic values for living well, Environmental Values, 32, 3, pp. 291-314, (2023); Bardi A., Schwartz S.H., Values and behavior: Strength and structure of relations, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 29, 10, pp. 1207-1220, (2003); Blaikie N., Designing Social Research, (2009); Bouman T., Steg L., Kiers H.A.L., Measuring values in environmental research: A test of an environmental portrait value questionnaire, Frontiers in Psychology, 9, (2018); Chan K.M., Et al., Opinion: Why protect nature?

To this end, it was examined to what extent youth become similar to their friends in moral disengagement, social goals, and a sense of peer community. Participants were 283 South Korean third to sixth graders (Mage = 9.60 years, SD = 0.97; 51.6% girls) who completed an online survey for moral disengagement, social goals, the sense of peer community and friendship network across the beginning (Time 1) and end (Time 2) of the school semester (September to December). Longitudinal social network analyses indicated that youth became more similar to their friends concerning moral disengagement and a sense of peer community, but did not select friends based on these aspects. The strength of these influence effects varied in terms of different levels of these aspects. Specifically, youth were more likely to become similar to their friends at lower levels of moral disengagement. Youth tended to be similar to the friends’ level of sense of peer community. This tendency was relatively strong at the lowest and the highest levels of a sense of peer community. Future research should address the role of friendship in shaping classroom citizenship and the importance of classroom daily teaching practice in youth citizenship development. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.","A sense of peer community; Friendship dynamics; Longitudinal social network analysis; Moral disengagement; Social goals","Adolescent; Child; Citizenship; Female; Friends; Goals; Humans; Male; Morals; Peer Group; Peer Influence; adolescent; adult; aged; article; citizenship; community; controlled study; diagnosis; female; friend; friendship; human; longitudinal study; male; moral disengagement; motivation; peer pressure; school; social network analysis; South Korean; teaching; child; morality; motivation; peer group","","","","","Almeida A., Correia I., Marinho S., Moral disengagement, normative beliefs of peer group, and attitudes regarding roles in bullying, Journal of School Violence, 9, 1, pp. 23-36, (2009); Bandura A., On Structural Evil: Disengaging from Our Moral Selves, (2016); Bandura A., Cherry L., Enlisting the power of youth for climate change, American Psychologist, 75, 7, pp. 945-951, (2020); Bandura A., Barbaranelli C., Caprara G.V., Pastorelli C., Mechanisms of moral disengagement in the exercise of moral agency, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 71, 2, pp. 364-374, (1996); Battistich V., Effects of a school-based program to enhance prosocial development on children’s peer relations and social adjustment, Journal of Character Education, 1, 1, pp. 1-17, (2003); Battistich V., Solomon D., Kim D.I., Watson M., Schaps E., A multilevel analysis of schools as communities, poverty levels of student populations, and students’ attitudes, motives, and performance, American Educational Research Journal, 32, 3, pp. 627-658, (1995); Bjarehed M., Thornberg R., Wanstrom L., Gini G., Moral disengagement and verbal bullying in early adolescence: a three-year longitudinal study, Journal of School Psychology, 84, pp. 63-73, (2021); Brechwald W.A., Prinstein M.J., Beyond homophily: a decade of advances in understanding peer influence processes, Journal of Research on Adolescence, 21, 1, pp. 166-179, (2011); Friendship as process, function, and outcome, Handbook of Peer Interactions, Relationships, and Groups, pp. 217-231, (2009); Bussey K., Development of moral disengagement: Learning to make wrong right, The Oxford Handbook of Moral Development: An Interdisciplinary Perspective, pp. 306-326, (2020); Caravita S.C., Cillessen A.H., Agentic or communal?

This democratization of Enterprise Architecture allows organizations to transform faster and take advantage of trends such as the API Economy, Software-as-a-Service, and Citizen Developers with low-code applications. From this perspective, in this paper, we present the most common challenges that organizations face in their Enterprise Architecture practice due to siloed information and lack of communication between stakeholders. Furthermore, using tools like Excel and PowerPoint to manage the architecture poses challenges due to obsolete data, inability to create meaningful analyses and having multiple sources of truth. In the case of C&A, Helvetia and Marc O’Polo we present how having a modern data-driven Enterprise Architecture has helped these organizations with addressing their challenges and transforming quickly.

Through meticulous research into single-family housing in Toronto, encompassing aspects such as zoning regulations, historical typologies, strategies for conversion and costs, ReHousing strives to serve as a platform for citizen empowerment. Its primary objective is to foster the emergence of a new type of housing developers, referred to as “citizen developers.” On the other hand, “Santiago, Cooperative City,” is a thesis and professional degree project presented in the MARQ UC program. Inspired by a contemporary reinterpretation of Alison and Peter Smithson’s ideas on housing and social interaction, this project reimagines the residential densification of downtown Santiago, taking as its starting point the site of the historic international architecture competition for the remodeling of downtown Santiago (1972). © 2024, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile.

Drawing on interview data and examples of digital activity shared by the students, we adopt the theories of digital literacies and translanguaging and transsemiotizing to reveal how they construct digital citizenship through an complex interplay between several factors, most prominently (1) a variety of digitally mediated social, cultural and educational practices the students engage in, (2) their agency of deploying diverse linguistic and semiotic recourses to achieve varied communicative effects in different settings and (3) their personal pursuits of intellectual and professional development and social engagement in a digitalized and globalized society. We then discuss how the findings can enrich our understanding of digital citizenship and its relationship with digital literacies in a multilingual and multicultural context such as Hong Kong. The implications for digital citizenship education are also discussed. © 2023","Digital citizenship; Digital literacy practices; Social media; Spatial repertoire; Translanguaging","","","","","","Akcil U., Bastas M., Examination of university students' attitudes towards e-learning during the COVID-19 pandemic process and the relationship of digital citizenship, Contemporary Educational Technology, 13, 1, (2020); Alber J.M., Bernhardt J.M., Stellefson M., Weiler R.M., Anderson-Lewis C., Miller M.D., MacInnes J., Designing and testing an inventory for measuring social media competency of certified health education specialists, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 17, 9, (2015); Birzea C., European citizenship as a cultural and political construct, Journal of Social Science Education, 4, 3, (2005); Bolander B., Locher M.A., Beyond the online offline distinction: Entry points to digital discourse, Discourse, Context & Media, 35, (2020); Buchholz B.A., DeHart J., Moorman G., Digital citizenship during a global pandemic: Moving beyond digital literacy, Journal of Adolescent & Adult Literacy, 64, 1, pp. 11-17, (2020); Canagarajah S., Codemeshing in academic writing: Identifying teachable strategies of translanguaging, The Modern Language Journal, 95, 3, pp. 401-417, (2011); Canagarajah S., Translingual practice: Global Englishes and cosmopolitan relations, (2013); Canagarajah S., Clarifying the relationship between translingual practice and L2 writing: Addressing learner identities, Applied Linguistics Review, 6, 4, pp. 415-440, (2015); Canagarajah S., Shuttling between scales in the workplace: Reexamining policies and pedagogies for migrant professionals, Linguistics and Education, 34, pp. 47-57, (2016); Chen L.L., Mirpuri S., Rao N., Law N., Conceptualization and measurement of digital citizenship across disciplines, Educational Research Review, 33, (2021); Chen X., Ostlund B., Frennert S., Digital inclusion or digital divide for older immigrants?

The aim of this paper is to explore the integration of sustainable tourism into the development of Lampang, a city in northern Thailand. By collaborating with government and private agencies, academics, community leaders and the people of Lampang to reskill and upskill core community groups in the city, the researchers hope to enhance active citizenship, develop relevant skills and foster leadership networks that boost Lampang’s appeal as a sustainable tourism destination. Design/methodology/approach: Data were gathered from brainstorming meetings, focus group discussions, observations and in-depth interviews. After identifying key characteristics required for creative citizens of Lampang city, the researchers developed and implemented pilot curricula with five target groups. Activities were developed to nurture creative leaders and promote innovative use of traditional culture and lifestyle. Findings: The findings revealed that targeted local curricula can harness the cultural capital of the local community and equip locals with a modern toolkit to lay the foundations for a creative, livable tourist city. Originality/value: This study’s originality lies in its grassroots approach to defining creative citizenship. It captures local community perspectives on what constitutes a creative citizen. Moreover, this research demonstrates how custom-designed educational initiatives can effectively nurture a creative and resilient urban ecosystem. This offers a blueprint for culturally informed urban regeneration, highlighting the role of sustainable tourism in enhancing the city’s attractiveness and livability for both residents and visitors. © 2024, International Tourism Studies Association.","Creative citizens; Cultural capital; Livable city; Reskill; Sustainable tourism; Upskill; Urban development","","","","","","Ashworth G., Page S.J., Urban tourism research: Recent progress and current paradoxes, Tourism Management, 32, 1, pp. 1-15, (2011); Bayliss D., The rise of the creative city: Culture and creativity in Copenhagen, European Planning Studies, 15, 7, pp. 889-903, (2007); Bevolo M., Amati F., A strategic process to anticipate the digital blurring of urban work and leisure, World Leisure Journal, 62, 3, pp. 200-218, (2020); Bickley S.J., Macintyre A., Torgler B., Safety in smart, livable cities: Acknowledging the human factor.

Effective documented interventions rely on fake news identification and peer corrective actions. Based on a mixed-method convergent design, this study independently (1) investigates how citizens develop strategies to identify fake news and generate rational motivations to engage in corrective actions (Study 1, 51 in-depth adults’ interviews in Spain) and (2) tests the direct and indirect effects, via cognitive news elaboration, of traditional, social media, and fake news exposure leading to corrective measures (Study 2, with U.S. survey data). Study 1 shows that the fake news identification process is based on two distinctive layers: cognitive processes related to news content appraisal and a follow-up consumption of media resources (i.e., fact-checkers). Study 2 shows how traditional news use exhibited a direct relationship with corrective responses, whereas fake news and social media news exposure are only indirectly associated to corrective actions through cognitive elaboration. The findings contribute new insights about how to combat misinformation. © 2023 (Homero Gil de Zúñiga, Manuel Goyanes, and Chris Skurka).

Family members play a very important role in caring for the senior citizens. They must understand the problems in order to take care of the health and environment of the senior citizens correctly and appropriately. In addition, applying the four principles of Bhāvanā as a guideline to support the aging society will help the senior citizens to be happy, have a better mental state, and be able to rely on themselves. The objectives of this research article are to study the health care system to support the aging society and apply the four principles of Bhāvanā in health care to support the aging society. Methodology: The study employed a qualitative research method by collecting data from related documents and in-depth interviews. Key informants included two scholar monks, two representatives from Hospital, two Village Health Volunteers (VHV), two temple volunteers, four senior citizens, and four caregivers, with a total of sixteen people. Main Results: The study results indicated that: 1) Health care system to support the aging society consisted of creating a network for healthcare systems to the senior citizens by creating a joint plan with the sub-district health promoting hospital, community, and senior citizens. The potential development of the health care network for senior citizens was conducted by workshop meetings to continuously follow up on the health care network for them. The establishment of schools for senior citizens was conducted through a meeting to appoint a committee to operate the care of senior citizens. It included network partners operating under the concept of promoting a lifelong learning process. Training to provide knowledge to caregivers of the senior citizens was a training program for caregivers. The senior citizen's caregivers were the mainstays to care for, follow up with, and visit senior citizens who were homebound and bedridden. The supervisor team provided supervision, evaluated performance, and organized a forum to exchange knowledge; and 2) The application of the four principles of Bhāvanā in health care to support the aging society consisted of physical, moral, emotional, and wisdom development. For physical development, the senior citizens developed themselves through physical awareness by considering factors that affected health. For moral development, the senior citizens developed themselves by adjusting behavior to promote their health by using healthcare to create a healthy society. For emotional development, the senior citizens developed themselves by making their minds comfortable and being kind to community members. For wisdom development, the senior citizens developed themselves through continuous learning by acknowledging and passing on knowledge to community members. Involvement to Buddhadhamma: This research article is involved Applied Buddhism within the group of Buddhism for social benefits by applying the four principles of Bhāvanā for strengthening the aging society includes; physical development, which means having a supportive relationship for the physical environment of the senior citizens to have good physical health; moral development, which means having a supportive relationship with maintaining morality; emotional development, which means strengthening knowledge, thoughts, and understanding by developing a calm mind; and wisdom development, which means the search for knowledge of the senior citizens is always increasing. Conclusions: Health care to support the aging society applied the four principles of Bhāvanā to help senior citizens be happy and able to rely on themselves. It started when senior citizens developed healthcare behaviors. Senior citizens maintained good health, were kind, and helped the community and society. They organized activities to promote the health of the senior citizens and the community in unity. They developed their comfort through continuous learning and inherited knowledge to community members. © 2024, Temple of Wang Tawan Tok.

Objective: We aim to provide a systematic review of the current research on the adoption of LCNC technologies within citizen development (CD) practices for digital transformation (DT), and to propose a research agenda for this field. Method: This review is primarily conducted using a multi-phase systematic literature review of publications from the past five years, i.e., between 2017 and 2023. Results: We identified 40 primary studies that describes the application of LCNC development and CD practices, the theoretical lenses/frameworks used, and the associated benefits and challenges. Conclusion: In this study, we present three key contributions. First, we provide a comprehensive review of the benefits, challenges, theoretical perspectives, and methods used to explore LCNC and CD adoption. Second, we introduce a framework designed to guide managers in effectively adopting LCNC and CD practices. Finally, our systematic review uncovers gaps in existing research and identifies opportunities for further exploration, which paves the way for a future research agenda. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.","Citizen development; Digital transformation; Low-code; No-code; Systematic literature review","Citizen development; Code development; Development practices; Digital transformation; Emerging technologies; Low-code; No-code; Research agenda; Systematic literature review; Systematic Review","","","","","Abidin A., Senin N., Manaf A.A.A., A Preliminary Study of Low-Code/No-Code ecosystem practices: translating design student views on crafting interactive design, NVEO Nat.

The lack of proper training among many of these informal volunteers, however, raises concerns about their potential to inadvertently cause harm. Within the disaster response community, there is a growing need to understand the collaboration dynamics between spontaneous volunteers and government officials in disaster response planning. This paper quantitatively evaluates the value of collaboration between formal government agencies and informal citizen volunteers in disaster response operations. It investigates the potential for informal volunteers' involvement to enhance the effectiveness of disaster response under different collaboration strategies. The study aims to identify best practices for coordinating officials and citizens, develop novel collaborative response models, and assess those models’ performance in emergencies. To achieve this goal, agent-based simulation is employed to model alternative collaboration strategies between the government and informal volunteers across various disaster scenarios. The simulation incorporates verified request locations from emergency phone calls and on-the-ground assessment data, as well as unverified request locations obtained from social media platforms. The objective of this study is to examine various collaboration strategies and assess their impact on the response rates of disaster victims, considering different citizen-related, responder-related, and logistics-related disaster factors. This research provides insights into the current state of emergency management activities and proposes improvements to enhance the effectiveness of disaster response efforts. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Agencies; Agent-based; Collaboration; Disaster response; Simulation; Spontaneous volunteers","","","","","","Historic disaster response to Hurricane Harvey in Texas, (2017); Fink S., Blinder A., Houston's hospitals treat storm victims and become victims themselves, N.

Despite the escalating organizational interest in investing in technological advancements, the Oil and Gas (O&G) industry lags in the digitalization race. This research aims to introduce a conceptual framework for businesses to succeed in digital transformation and maintain competitive operations through digitalization. The Digital Transformation Framework was applied in an O&G company based in Brazil, focused on the Subsea segment, and is built upon three key pillars. First, defining the digital's identity for the company, the materialization in a long-term strategy, and leadership sponsorship. Second, establishing partnerships with IT and Finance departments, and suppliers, the project management and execution engine layer is a channel to collect ideas, workflow for implementation, and follow-up meetings. The third pillar is related to people, which embraces a strong communication plan, the volunteer work of digital agents, the empowerment of employees as developers, and an upskilling program to increase competencies. The implementation of the framework has successfully increased the digital maturity of the organization and facilitated a sustainable cultural transformation. The framework enabled the generation of improvement ideas, led the automation of critical processes, and enhanced data management. Also, empowered employees to deliver developments independently, and these individuals have been designated as citizen developers. Moreover, the Digital Agents' role promoted a vital contribution to cultural formation. Their influence and support in major areas have elevated the digital culture, promoting the team's involvement and delivering projects autonomously. Likewise, a training program based on digital awareness following an upskilling plan and linked to business strategy allowed the implementation of new technologies in daily operations. Also, incentive mechanisms were established based on financial recognition, increasing employee visibility to those aligned with the corporate strategy and promoting cultural development. Finally, the partnership with technical developers and suppliers was strengthened, including academia for specialized and high-technological projects. The Digital Transformation Framework fosters innovation and provides a practical digitalization approach that tailors its applicability to an O&G industry, defining processes, responsibilities, and stakeholders’ collaboration. This case study presents valuable insights regarding feasible implications for companies that embarked on their digital transformation journey and those seeking to navigate the digital landscape. © Copyright 2023, Offshore Technology Conference.","","Gas industry; Information management; Offshore oil well production; Offshore technology; Personnel training; Conceptual frameworks; Digital identity; Digital transformation; Industrial sector; Long-term strategy; Oil and gas companies; Oil and Gas Industry; Organizational interests; Technological advancement; Transformation process; Project management","","","","","Alfedaghi Hadla S., Citizen Developers – KIPIC Case Study: Empowering Innovation and Accelerating Digital Transformation, the SPE/IADC Middle East Drilling Technology Conference and Exhibition, (2023); Aliu J., Aigbavboa C., Thwala W., A 21st Century Employability Skills Improvement Framework for the Construction Industry, (2021); Baker J., The Technology–Organization–Environment Framework, Integrated Series in Information Systems, pp. 231-245, (2011); Bandeira G.

However, despite LCDPs' productivity benefits and widespread adoption by individuals with no formal coding background (“citizen developers”), professional developers remain skeptical about implementing LCDPs for their own tasks, questioning LCDPs' capability for “real” development. This study explores this skepticism through 18 interviews with professional developers. We find that professional developers' willingness to adopt LCDPs can be explained by constructs of established technology acceptance theory and by different types of software development tasks that professionals believe LCDPs can take over (namely repetitive and conceptual tasks). Based on our findings, we contribute to LCDP and technology adoption literature and provide recommendations to make LCDPs more appealing to professional developers. These guidelines aim to assist LCDP providers and organizations in broadening LCDPs' appeal and encouraging adoption among professional users. © 2024 30th Americas Conference on Information Systems, AMCIS 2024.

However, owing to the existence of emerging policies, these innovations have raised issues in the educational sector. Therefore, in this paper, EP-SE has been proposed for enhancing the sustainable environment in education and global citizenship. EP-SE seeks to elucidate the educational developments and reveal the part played by non-discursive components in ensuring global citizenship cooperation. The emerging policies for sustainable development emphasize the importance of moral ideals, personal accountability, and engaged global citizenship. Capitalist debate impartially privileges a real economy based on the individual and enhanced income. EP-SE has been developed within the current commodity conditions, critical democracy, and threats to educational development and can serve as a model for sustainable global citizenship development. The experimental results suggest that the proposed model achieves the highest performance compared with the other existing methods. © 2023 by the authors.","critical democracy; EP-SE; global citizenship; sustainable environment","democracy; educational development; sustainability; training","","","","","O'Flaherty J., Liddy M., The impact of development education and education for sustainable development interventions: A synthesis of the research, Environ.

Developing the student's democratic citizenship is not an explicit aim of history teaching in the current core curriculum although the aims of history teaching there are very much about civic skills that support deliberative, participatory and liberal democracy. Support to the student's democratic citizenship and the liberal-democratic society is more visible as a goal in the sections of the core curriculum that describe the general goals and principles of basic education. In the paper it is suggested that the emphasis on the skills to construct, analyse and evaluate historical interpretations in the history curriculum overshadows more directly societal aims and political aspects of history teaching that are relevant in developing the student's democratic citizenship. It is suggested also that bringing third-order concepts in the history curriculum could valuably support the student's democratic citizenship and democratic consciousness by focusing on the personal meanings of history to the student – a perspective too often neglected in the curriculum. © The Author(s) 2025.","curriculum studies; democratic consciousness; Finland; Historical consciousness; history teaching","","","","","","Ahonen S., Tasa-arvoa vai tasapäisyyttä?, (2008); Ahonen S., A study of the transformation of Finnish history textbook narratives after World War II, European Politics and Society, 21, 3, pp. 1-15, (2019); Ahonen S., Form or substance?

The advent and evolution of Rapid Application Development (RAD) methodologies has facilitated the empowerment of non-programmers, particularly those with extensive business process expertise, to develop software, thus giving rise to the term’Citizen Developers’. Currently, there exist numerous approaches encompassing frameworks, platforms, and tools that facilitate citizen development, including low-code platforms, no-code platforms, code automations, and spreadsheet-driven development. Nevertheless, the industry and software development community have yet to widely adopt these methods. Through an examination of the benefits and drawbacks of Re-CRUD code automation, it is anticipated that this approach may offer potential as a software development solution for individuals without programming expertise. However, enhancements to its ease of use and accessibility are necessary. The outcomes and suggestions derived from this analysis would furnish a more robust foundation for the assimilation and advancements of the methodologies of citizen development among the sector and the wider software development populace. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Citizen Developers; Code Automation; Low-Code Development; No-Code Development; Non-Programmers; Rapid Application Development; Software Engineering; Software Prototype; Spreadsheet-driven Development","Application programs; Automation; Software design; Software prototyping; Citizen developer; Code automation; Code development; Low-code development; No-code development; Non-programmer; Rapid application development; Software prototype; Spreadsheet-driven development; Spreadsheets","","","","","Ahmed K., Et al., How Can IT Empower Citizen Developers?, California, (2017); Tisi M., Et al., Lowcomote: Training the next generation of experts in scalable low-code engineering platforms, CEUR Workshop Proc, 2405, (2019); Oltrogge M., Et al., The Rise of the Citizen Developer: Assessing the Security Impact of Online App Generators, Proc. - IEEE Symp.

We present the exploration of a craftsmanship-driven approach to engage people in CT. To explore this approach a team of knitters, a computer scientist and a computing education expert iteratively designed the KnitxCode workshop. KnitxCode utilises knitting in combination with CT concepts as the foundation for the activities. The workshop was evaluated by 12 participants with no programming experience and with knitting experience ranging from 2-25 years (M = 6). From the evaluation we found that the craftsmanship-driven approach seemed to provide the participants with confidence to learning CT, as shared concepts and practices between knitting and computing supported transitioning from knitting craftsmanship to computing and in this way served to demystify computing. © 2022 Owner/Author.","computational thinking; craftsmanship; knitting; novice programming","Computational thinkings; Computer scientists; Computing education; Computing skills; Craftsmanship; Education experts; Knitting; Novice programming; Programming experience","","","","","Bdeir A., Electronics as material: Littlebits, Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Tangible and Embedded Interaction., pp. 397-400, (2009); Bergin J., Fourteen pedagogical patterns, EuroPLoP., pp. 1-49, (2000); Blikstein P., Gears of our childhood: Constructionist toolkits, robotics, and physical computing, past and future, Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Interaction Design and Children., pp. 173-182, (2013); Brennan K., Resnick M., New frameworks for studying and assessing the development of computational thinking, Proceedings of the 2012 Annual Meeting of the American Educational Research Association, 1, (2012); Buechley L., A construction kit for electronic textiles, 2006 10th IEEE International Symposium on Wearable Computers.

However, due to the difficulties involved in measuring it, there are no clear criteria as to which aspects of the economy should be enhanced in order to improve life conditions. In this respect, just as in the past literacy enabled human development and integration, these days, the use of new technologies and technological capacity are key elements that facilitate citizens' development. In this study, we use the information available in the Flash Eurobarometer 419 and Eurostat data on Information and Communications Technology to analyse the factors that Europeans consider key to achieving a better quality of life. We can thus see how the use of new technologies and technological capacity influence these factors. This analysis has been carried out at the highest level of disaggregation possible given the available information, and includes a total of 79 European NUTS 2 regions. The results reveal a clear relationship between technology and quality of life; the digital citizen is happier and values living in regions/cities with technological capacity, which invest in R&D, and which are committed to achieving sustainable growth. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Capacity; Europe; ICT; NUTS 2 regions; Quality of life; Use","Europe; Sustainable development; Capacity; Disaggregation; Europe; Human development; Information and communications technology; NUTS 2 regions; Quality of life; Sustainable growth; information and communication technology; perception; quality of life; statistical analysis; sustainability; technology adoption; Engineering education","","","","","Adler P.S., Kwon S.-W., Social capital: prospects for a new concept, Acad.

Nowadays the low-code development is expected to provide an ability to develop ERP systems with high efficiency, using well-established component/service and cloud platform technologies. And nonprofessional staff who understand business can easily participate in ERP development. Any change of ERP process is always driven by that of business requirements. So, requirement-driven business process design was discussed in this paper to implement the ERP low-code development. And a framework was proposed to demonstrate the implementation of such development, in which any change of business requirement was decomposed into that of composing parts, process nodes and the involved cloud services/components.  © 2022 IEEE.","citizen developer; cloud; ERP; low-code","Process design; Business Process; Business requirement; Citizen developer; Cloud development; Code development; ERP system; Higher efficiency; Low-code; Manufacturing enterprise; Service platforms; Enterprise resource planning","","","","","(2021); (2014); Anvaari M., Cruzes D.S., Conradi R., Smart Grid software applications as an ultra-large-scale system: Challenges for evolution, Procedding of Innovative Smart Grid Technologies (ISGT), pp. 1-6; Wu S.L., He W., Enterprise Systems from ERP, IERP to ERP, IEEE SMC eNewsletter, 35, (2011); Demuth A., Lopez-Herrejon R.E., Egyed A., Automatically generating and adapting model constraints to support co-evolution of design models, Proceedings of the 27th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE), September 2012, pp. 302-305; Li H., Zhao H., Cai W., Et al., A modular attachment mechanism for software network evolution, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 392, pp. 2025-2037, (2013); Pacheco C.L., Garcia I.A., Calvo-Manzano J.A., Arcilla M., A proposed model for reuse of software requirements in requirements catalog, Journal of Software : Evolution and Process, 27, 1, pp. 1-21, (2015); Zhang Y., Xi D., Li R., Sun S., Task-driven manufacturing cloud service proactive discovery and optimal configuration method, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 84, 1-4, pp. 29-45, (2016); Cao Y., Wang S., Kang L., Gao Y., A TQCS-based service selection and scheduling strategy in cloud manufacturing, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 84, 1-4, pp. 235-251, (2016); Fisher O., Watson N., Porcu L., Et al., Cloud manufacturing as a sustainable process manufacturing route, Journal of Manufacturing systems, 47, pp. 53-68, (2018); Wei D., Zhang J., Li X., Et al., Business Process-aware ERP Development and Evolution, Proceedings of the 2015 International Conference on Electronic Science and Automation Control (ESAC2015), pp. 31-34, (2015)","L.

In spite of their critical importance in Japanese society, very few studies have systematically examined how war memories influence Japanese citizens' views toward defense issues. The present research addresses the gap in the literature. More specifically, this study examines how exposures to war memories shape Japanese citizens' opinions of the Self-Defense Forces (SDF). Building upon the implications from studies on peace education and international relations, I hypothesize that exposures to war memories enhance Japanese citizens' support for the SDF's “reassurance” Strategy, which emphasizes a more conciliatory stance in the world. Results of the statistical analysis relying on the survey data in Japan verify the validity of this hypothesis. By dissecting the process through which Japanese citizens develop their opinions about defense policy, this study significantly advances our understanding of the relationship between peace education and international relations, thus providing critical implications that are highly useful in understanding Japan's security culture. © 2020 German Institute for Japanese Studies.","Japan; reassurance; Self-Defense Forces; war memories","","","","","","Arai K., Izumikawa Y., Nihonjin ha dono tēdo buryoku kōshi ni maemuki nanoka?

In this study, we sought to understand how students at an urban liberal arts college in the United States framed their own and others’ efficacy and responsibility in narrative accounts of situations they faced in civic and community engagement. We were interested in how young people learn and work alongside local stakeholders, rather than serve on behalf of people and communities considered to be in need. We aimed to gain insight into occasions in which collaborative agency emerged, or failed to emerge, in the coordinated activity of individuals engaged in the creation of intersubjectivity, shared commitments, and perceptions of group accomplishment. We collected narratives over a 4-year period from 123 Bonner Scholars, campus leaders whose scholarship includes a substantial weekly commitment to service. Our analysis of stories featuring or problematizing collaborative agency showed students grappling with limits of collaborative agency, but also generativity and interdependence. They described civic agency and leadership with other students, non-profit partners, and citizens. In some settings, we heard students striving for a collaborative solidarity, moving beyond collaborative agency toward relationships affording mutual empowerment. © The Author(s) 2020.","Bonner Scholars; citizenship development; collaborative agency; college students; community engagement; narratives","adult; article; citizenship; college student; drug efficacy; empowerment; human; leadership; narrative; perception; responsibility; United States","","","","","Bamberg M., Who am I?

Through involvement in participatory mechanisms, citizens develop various skills, become better informed, and cultivate a greater sense of political efficacy. There has been considerable debate in the academic literature over the extent to which participation can produce these benefits, but deliberative and participatory theoretical approaches have been criticised for neglecting power dynamics within participatory mechanisms themselves, and for overlooking structural inequalities between women and men. Numerous critics have charged that participatory mechanisms tend to mask, but not eliminate, gender inequalities, particularly in societies where these remain firmly entrenched. While the theory on the educational function of participatory democracy is well developed, there remains a lack of empirical work on the impact of participation on women in Latin America, a region that has been at the forefront of democratic innovation. Based on extensive fieldwork in Venezuela, Ecuador and Chile, this article identifies the types of skills that women gain through participation, and questions the extent to which these reproduce traditional gender roles.  © 2022 The Author(s).","Chile; Ecuador; learning outcomes; participatory democracy; political participation; Venezuela; women","Chile; Ecuador; Venezuela; democracy; education; gender issue; local participation; womens status","","","","","Fung A., Reinventing Democracy in Latin America, Perspectives on Politics, 9, 4, pp. 857-871, (2011); Ramirez F., Welp Y., Nuevas instituciones participativas y democráticas en América Latina, Íconos: Revista de Ciencias Sociales, 40, pp. 11-20, (2011); Pateman C., Participation and Democratic Theory, (1970); Barber B., Strong Democracy: Participatory Politics for a New Age, (1984); Mendelson M., Cutler F., The Effect of Referendums on Democratic Citizens: Information, Politicization, Efficacy and Tolerance, British Journal of Political Science, 30, 4, pp. 669-698, (2000); Smith D., Tolbert C., Citizens and Political Organizations in the American States, (2004); Dyck J., Initiated Distrust: Direct Democracy and Trust in Government, American Politics Research, 37, 4, pp. 539-568, (2009); Della Porta D., For Participatory Democracy, Some Notes, European Political Science, 18, pp. 603-616, (2018); Glassman M., Patton R., Capability through Participatory Democracy: Sen, Freire, and Dewey, Educational Philosophy and Theory, 46, 12, pp. 1353-1365, (2014); Hill-Collins P., The Difference that Power Makes: Intersectionality and Participatory Democracy, Investigaciones Feministas, 8, 1, pp. 19-39, (2017); Pateman C., Participatory Democracy Revisited, Perspectives on Politics, 10, 1, pp. 7-19, (2012)","P.

Through higher-level abstractions citizen developers are enabled to develop increasingly complex software systems. While this improves productivity and efficiency it also introduces new challenges in the development process. The evolution of the low-code development platform and the applications built on top of it is one of those challenges. Understanding the impact of changes on the software system is crucial for both the maintenance as well as the improvement of running software. Citizen developers can be supported by direct feedback that reflects how their changes impact the system. Professional developers can use the impact analysis to correctly migrate existing data. Finally, the operations engineers that are responsible for the availability of the platform and the applications can plan seamless upgrades of new versions. Impact analysis should be at the foundations of the development of low-code development platforms. This paper proposes the Impact Analysis for Low-Code Development Platforms framework, a conceptual framework that supports the discussion, research, and implementation of impact analysis. The proposed framework describes the different subsystems and artifacts in a low-code development platform, the different types of professionals involved, and how these professionals can use impact analysis to support their engineering decisions. Through a descriptive case study we discuss the role of impact analysis in an industry low-code development platform. Through the feedback acquired by impact analysis, professionals can stay in control of the evolution of both the applications as well as the low-code development platform itself. © 2021 IEEE.","Change Impact Analysis; Citizen/end-user Development; Co-Development; Evolution; Low-Code Development Platform","Codes (symbols); Computer programming; Computer software; Software design; Change impact analysis; Citizen/end-user development; Co-development; Code development; Development platform; End-User Development; Evolution; Higher-level abstraction; Impact analysis; Low-code development platform; Feedback","","","","","Cabot J., Positioning of the low-code movement within the field of model-driven engineering, Proceedings -23rd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems, MODELS-C 2020-Companion Proceedings, pp. 535-537, (2020); Sahay A., Indamutsa A., Di Ruscio D., Pierantonio A., Supporting the understanding and comparison of low-code development platforms, Proceedings -46th Euromicro Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications, Seaa 2020, pp. 171-178, (2020); Zolotas C., Chatzidimitriou K.C., Symeonidis A.L., Restsec: A low-code platform for generating secure by design enterprise services, Enterprise Information Systems, 12, 8-9, pp. 1007-1033, (2018); Pantelimon S.G., Rogojanu T., Braileanu A., Stanciu V.D., Dobre C., Towards a seamless integration of iot devices with iot platforms using a low-code approach, Ieee 5th World Forum on Internet of Things, WF-IoT 2019-Conference Proceedings, pp. 566-571, (2019); Sanchis R., Garcia-Perales O., Fraile F., Poler R., Low-code as enabler of digital transformation in manufacturing industry, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 10, 1, (2020); Overeem M., Jansen S., Fortuin S., Generative versus interpretive model-driven development: Moving past 'it depends, Model-Driven Engineering and Software Development.

This study aims to identify the livability dimensions and their relationship with the sense of community. The survey method was applied, and a sample of 392 residents of a Brazilian region was interviewed. The results show that three dimensions—(1) trust and safety, (2) work and bridging relations, and (3) housing and city performance—explain livability. Among these dimensions, trust and safety and housing and city performance have a significant relation to the sense of community, explaining 32.4% of the sense of community. These results point out elements for the elaboration of plans and public policies in the cities and as critical elements for future research.

Participants were two consecutive cohorts of university students enrolled in nine international service-learning projects. Mixed-method findings from the first cohort reveal significant increases in their global competence and intercultural effectiveness but not their social responsibility or global civic engagement. Targeted improvement actions were planned and implemented accordingly for the subsequent cohort, resulting in significant increases in their social responsibility in addition to global competence and intercultural effectiveness scores. No significant increase, however, was found in students’ global civic engagement. The findings suggest that action research can be an effective strategy to improve students’ global citizenship and intercultural effectiveness development from international service-learning, and that explicit and intentional elements are needed in the learning and reflective activities to develop these attributes. Implications for practice and future research are discussed. © 2020 Educational Action Research.","action research; global citizenship; intercultural effectiveness; International service-learning","","","","","","Bennett M., A Developmental Approach to Training for Intercultural Sensitivity, International Journal of Intercultural Relations, 10, 2, pp. 179-186, (1986); Biott G., The Foundations of Classroom Research Action Research in Initial Teacher Training, Journal of Education for Training, 9, pp. 152-160, (1983); Bringle R.G., Hatcher J.A., International Service Learning, International Service Learning: Conceptual Frameworks and Research, pp. 3-28, (2011); Brown N., Embedding Engagement in Higher Education: Preparing Global Citizenship through International Service-learning, Campus Compact 20th Anniversary Visioning Summit, (2007); Camacho M.M., Power and Privilege: Community Service Learning in Tijuana, Michigan Journal of Community Service Learning, 10, 3, pp. 31-42, (2004); Chan S.C.F., Ngai G., Yau J.H.Y., Kwan K.P., Impact of International Service-Learning on University Students’ Global Citizenship and Intercultural Effectiveness Development, International Association of Research on Service-Learning and Community Engagement, New Orleans, LA, July 18-20, in press, (2018); Corey S.M., Action Research in Education, The Journal of Educational Research, 47, 5, pp. 375-380, (1954); Crabtree R.D., Theoretical Foundations for International Service-learning, Michigan Journal of Community Service Learning, 15, pp. 18-36, (2008); Curtin A.J., Martins D.C., Schwartz-Barcott D., DiMaria L., Oganda B.M.S., Development and Evaluation of an International Service Learning Program for Nursing Students, Public Health Nursing, 30, 6, pp. 548-556, (2013); Dyke K., Advantages of Action Research, Action Research - The Manual, (2019); Green S.S., Comer L., Elliott L., Neubrander J., Exploring the Value of an International Service-learning Experience in Honduras, Nursing Education Perspectives, 32, 5, pp. 302-307, (2011); Hartman E., Kiely R., Pushing Boundaries: Introduction to the Global Service-learning Special Section, Michigan Journal of Community Service Learning, 21, 1, pp. 55-63, (2014); Hendricks C.A., History of Action Research in Education, The Wiley Handbook of Action Research in Education, pp. 29-52, (2019); Kemmis S., McTaggart R., Nixon R., The Action Research Planning: Doing Critical Participatory Action Research, (2013); Kiely R., A Transformative Learning Model for Service Learning: A Longitudinal Case Study, Michigan Journal of Community Service Learning, 12, pp. 5-22, (2005); King J.T., Service-learning as a Site for Critical Pedagogy: A Case for Collaboration, Caring, and Defamiliarization across Borders, Journal of Experiential Education, 26, 3, pp. 121-137, (2004); Larsen M.A., Critical Global Citizenship and International Service Learning, Journal of Citizenship & Equity Education, 4, 1, pp. 1-43, (2014); Lee S.-Y., Olszewski-Kubilius P., Donahue R., Weimholt K., The Effects of a Service-learning Program on the Development of Civic Attitudes and Behaviors among Academically Talented Adolescents, Journal for the Education of the Gifted, 31, 2, pp. 165-197, (2007); Liu R.-L., Lin P.-Y., Changes in Multicultural Experience: Action Research on a Service Learning Curriculum, Systematic Practice and Action Research, 30, pp. 239-256, (2017); Lo K.W.K., Kwan K.P., Ngai G., Chan S.C.F., An Initial Exploration of the Cross-cultural Validity of the Global Citizenship Scale in the Hong Kong Setting, Paper presented at the 1st International Conference on Service-Learning, (2014); Lo K.W.K., Kwan K.P., Ngai G., Chan S.C.F., Cross-cultural Validation of the Global Citizenship Scale for Measuring Impacts of International Service-learning in Hong Kong Setting, Paper presented at the 3rd International Conference on Service-Learning, (2019); Marsolek M.D., Alcantara J.T., Quintero L.F., Jackels C.F., Cummings P.K., Wayne M., Vallejos C., Jackels S.C., Wastewater Treatment for a Coffee Processing Mill in Nicaragua: A Service-learning Design Project, International Journal for Service Learning in Engineering, 7, 1, pp. 69-92, (2012); McGrew A., Sustainable Globalization?

This helps citizens develop greater confidence in and adherence to multi-modal transport services. These applications adapt to the needs of the user during their journey through the data, statistics and trends extracted from their previous uses of the application. The My-Trac application is dedicated to the research and development of these user-centered services to improve the multi-modal experience using various techniques. Among these techniques are preference extraction systems, which extract user information from social networks, such as Twitter. In this article, we present a system that allows to develop a profile of the preferences of each user, on the basis of the tweets published on their Twitter account. The system extracts the tweets from the profile and analyzes them using the proposed algorithms and returns the result in a document containing the categories and the degree of affinity that the user has with each category. In this way, the My-Trac application includes a recommender system where the user receives preference-based suggestions about activities or services on the route to be taken. © 2021 by the authors.

Access to the commons for the enactment of gardening, farming and foraging by the urban poor, many recent internal migrants from rural areas, is contested by wealthier citizens, developers and political elites. Through qualitative research with households within the informal settlement of Korail in Dhaka’s urban core, and a range of stakeholders in governmental and non-governmental organizations, this study critiques competing policy visions that involve urban greening and urban green infrastructure.

As a result, city population growth has led to the emergence of applications that manage complex processes within cities by utilizing recent technological advances, thereby transforming them into smart cities. Besides automating complex processes within a city, technology also enables a simplified integration of citizens into identifying problems and creating corresponding solutions. This paper discusses an approach that enables citizens to design and later execute their own services within a smart city environment by employing conceptual modeling and microservices. The overall aim is to establish the role of a citizen developer. The proposed approach is then discussed within our proof of concept environment based on a drone tour guide case.  © 2022 Owner/Author.","citizen developer; conceptual modeling; drone scenario; microservices; Smart city","Population statistics; Smart city; Citizen developer; Complex Processes; Conceptual model; Corresponding solutions; Drone scenario; Microservice; Population growth; Simplified integration; Technological advances; Tour guide; Drones","","","","","Batty M., Axhausen K.W., Giannotti F., Pozdnoukhov A., Bazzani A., Wachowicz M., Ouzounis G., Portugali Y., Smart cities of the future, The European Physical Journal Special Topics, 214, pp. 481-518, (2012); Olive: Microservice Framework; Bork D., Buchmann R., Hawryszkiewycz I., Karagiannis D., Tantouris N., Walch M., Using conceptual modeling to support innovation challenges in smart cities, 2016 Ieee 18th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications; Ieee 14th International Conference on Smart City; Ieee 2nd International Conference on Data Science and Systems (HPCC/SmartCity/DSS), pp. 1317-1324, (2016); Bork D., Fill H., Karagiannis D., Miron E., Tantouris N., Walch M., Conceptual Modelling for Smart Cities: A Teaching Case, Interaction Design and Architecture(s), pp. 10-28, (2015); Camero A., Alba E., Smart City and information technology: A review, Cities, 93, pp. 84-94, (2019); Cerny T., Donahoo M.J., Trnka M., Contextual Understanding of Microservice Architecture: Current and Future Directions, Sigapp Appl.

In the industry, RPA vendors have not only provided out-of-the-box RPA bots to automate manual tasks on legacy software; they have also provided users a recorder to create their own bots for specialized tasks. However, if these recorders do not create generalizable bots, users risk facing a “bot sprawl” and governance problem. Building generalizable bots currently requires intervention from IT departments which are typically oversubscribed given their limited resources. Furthermore, the generalization process is typically long and tedious; it does not scale to cover the expansive needs of business users. We thus need a tool that can empower business users to act as citizen developers and build generalized bots themselves. In this work, we argue that the next generation of RPA bots must leverage artificial intelligence to learn from user interactions (through natural language or other modalities intuitive to citizen developers) and generalize to unseen settings. To achieve this, we first survey and assess the current state of the art in the RPA field for enabling citizen developers; and identify several key research challenges at the intersection of AI, RPA, and interactive task learning that must be addressed to realize the vision of RPA bots that continually learn new automation solutions from user interactions. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial intelligence; Learning; Robotic process automation; Teaching by instruction","Botnet; Intelligent robots; Learning systems; Automation vendors; Business enterprise; Business-users; Learn+; Learning; Legacy software; Process automation; Robotic process automation; Teaching by instruction; User interaction; Process control","","","","","Agostinelli S., Lupia M., Marrella A., Mecella M., Automated generation of executable RPA scripts from user interface logs, BPM 2020.

It is informed by the case of the collaborative arrangements developed between the city of Gothenburg and work integration social enterprises (WISE). The article builds upon collaborative governance and innovation literature and focuses specifically on the first reserved public procurements for buying work training and other services from WISE. Our findings show how a tool that originates from a market governing mechanism can develop into a collaborative governance and innovation instrument. The design and implementation of the reserved procurements set in motion collaborative innovation through creation of collaborative spaces, joint ownership and empowerment, and by turning market governance mechanisms into collaborative governance. First, the ‘looseness’ and ‘openness’ of the governmental arrangements and collaboration spaces created by local actors enabled collaborative innovation. Second, the longstanding innovativeness and collaboration of WISE also played an important role in the development of this collaborative instrument. Third, the small scale of WISE and the larger scale of municipal contracts resulted in scaling up strategies that helped shape collaborative, rather than competitive, practices among WISE, as well as the implementation and diffusion of the innovation. We end the article by discussing the study's implications for collaborative governance and innovation between local governments and civil society. © 2022 The Authors.

Some of these platforms also offer support for reuse to facilitate the development of similar applications. The offered mechanisms are usually elementary, they allow module reuse or building a new application from a template. However, they are insufficient to achieve the industrial level reuse necessary for software product lines (SPL). In fact, these platforms were conceived to help build standalone applications, not software families and even fewer software product lines. In this paper, we argue that the major limitation is that these platforms seldom provide access to their metamodel, the access to applications' models and code is also limited and, therefore, makes it harder to analyze commonality and variability and construct models based on it. An approach is proposed to surpass these limitations: firstly, a metamodel of the applications built with the platform is obtained, and then, based on the metamodel, a domain-specific language (DSL) that can express the models of the applications, including variability, is constructed. With this DSL, users can combine and reuse models from different applications to explore and build similar applications. The solution is illustrated with an industrial case study. A discussion of the results is presented as well as its limitations and related work. The authors hope that this work provides inspiration and some ideas that the community can explore to facilitate the adoption and implementation of SPLs in the context, and supported by, low-code platforms.  © 2021 Owner/Author.","domain specific languages;

When, how, and why some citizens develop a strong interest in politics is, however, less clear. This study analyzes the development of political interest during the formative years of adolescence, using a five-wave panel study among Swedish adolescents, covering a period of 4 years. Based on the citizen communication mediation model, we analyze how interest in political and current affairs news among family and friends influence adolescents’ political interest. Taken together, while the findings lend support for several of the hypotheses, mechanisms, and processes derived from the communication mediation model, parents appear more important than peers when it comes to shaping adolescents’ political interest. © The Author(s) 2017.","adolescents; communication mediation; news media use; political interest; socialization","","","","","","Aalberg T., Curran J., How media inform democracy: A comparative approach, (2012); Acock A., Discovering structural equation modeling using tata, (2013); Allison P.D., Fixed effects regression models, (2009); Bandura A., Social cognitive theory of mass communication, Media effects: Advances in theory and research, pp. 94-124, (2009); Baum C., An introduction to modern econometrics using stata, (2006); Boomgaarden H.G., Interpersonal and mass mediated political communication, Political communication.

In the present paper, we aim to contribute insights regarding these difficulties by discussing the case study of the ongoing development of shared information management systems (SIMSs). SIMSs form the backbone of state-of-the-art transparency schemes called 'hypertransparency' schemes. Such schemes offer small businesses the opportunity to establish more direct relationships with consumers and citizens. Developing a SIMS is complex, requiring collaboration between many different disciplines and practitioners. We discuss how our approach has evolved during the development process from a multidisciplinary towards a transdisciplinary approach. We outline the challenges that arise at the start of a project when the chosen approach does not match well with the research problem at hand. We discuss how we are planning to overcome these challenges. The case study presented here is relatively novel in the literature and thus should act as a valuable resource as the importance of integrated research grows. © 2022 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd..

One of the aims of the project was to combine the research activities—acoustic and image processing, urbanistic analysis and health and annoyance evaluation—with the dynamic collaboration with citizens and other stakeholders to create social and environmental impact, to raise awareness and design tools to improve citizenship development and empowerment. This first year of Sons al Balcó has shown that citizens are willing to participate in initiatives that work with their everyday life, because one year after the lockdown, a new soundscape map of Catalonia has been built with their collaboration and their perceptual impact from their balconies or windows. This has allowed the inclusion of other issues that enhance the final goal of describing and finding relationships between the annoyance caused by noise, and other factors as the environment (urban, suburban, rural) and the landscape, including the soundscape and noise levels in this evaluation. Objective measurements of (Formula presented.) have been conducted during the lockdown and in the months afterwards to describe the average noise and its possible link with outdoor activities. During this second collecting campaign, Sons al Balcó managed to gather more than 220 contributions. In this work, we detail the definitions of the metrics that include urbanistic and health-related environmental elements (water, trees, etc.), together with the socio-economic and demographic data that correspond to the answers of the questionnaires, and finally, the information extracted from the audios and the videos sent by the citizens. Preliminary results show encouraging dependencies between perception gathered with the questionnaires and the objective data collected, still in process of analysis, and a clear bias to a worse soundscape in 2021 in comparison to the 2020 campaign. © 2021 by the authors.","annoyance; citizen science; lockdown; perception; smart city; soundscape map","","","","","","Blanes N., Fons J., Houthuijs D., Swart W., de la Maza M., Ramos M., Castell N., van Kempen E., Noise in Europe 2017: Updated Assessment, (2017); Jee Y., WHO International Health Regulations Emergency Committee for the COVID-19 outbreak, Epidemiol.

In such intercultural educational environments, Anglophone Englishes now play a much less significant role in HE. This paper aims to explore to what extent Thai students who came back from study abroad (SA) in Anglophone countries have developed a sense of intercultural citizenship and their experiences and perceptions in relation to intercultural communication, ELT and SA. A mixed-method approach was adopted at four universities in Thailand. Extracts from semi-structured interviews and questionnaire data have been analyzed. Findings have been divided into three themes: 1) The usefulness of intercultural citizenship courses, 2) The development of intercultural citizenship from lived experience, and 3) ELF mindedness. According to the findings, we argue that intercultural citizenship education (Byram, Michael. 2008. From foreign language education to education for intercultural citizenship: Essays and reflections. Clevedon: Multilingual Matters) ought to be part of the pedagogic approach in both EMI and ELT classrooms, and ELT courses in Thailand should put more emphasis on strengthening learners' intercultural competence and awareness while also moving away from traditional methods associated with standard language ideologies. © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","ELF; ELT; EMI; intercultural citizenship; study abroad","","","","","","Baker Will, Research into practice: Cultural and intercultural awareness, Language Teaching, 48, 1, pp. 130-141, (2015); Baker Will, Culture and identity through English as a Lingua Franca: Rethinking concepts and goals in intercultural communication (Developments in English as a Lingua Franca 8), (2015); Baker Will, English as an academic lingua franca and intercultural awareness: Student mobility in the transcultural university, Language and Intercultural Communication, 16, 3, pp. 437-451, (2016); Baker Will, From intercultural to transcultural communication, Language and Intercultural Communication, pp. 1-14, (2021); Baker Will, Fang Fan, So maybe I'm a global citizen': Developing intercultural citizenship in English medium education, Language, Culture and Curriculum, 34, 1, pp. 1-17, (2021); Baker Will, Humphreys Gareth, Short-term study abroad: Conditions for intercultural learning and ELF understanding, The Japan Association of College English Teachers Special Interest Group on English as a Lingua Franca, 4, 5, pp. 24-47, (2021); Higher education statistics agency, (2022); Boonsuk Yusop, Fang Fan, Re-envisaging English medium instruction, intercultural citizenship development, and higher education in the context of studying abroad, Language and Education, pp. 1-17, (2021); Bourn Douglas, Students as global citizens, Internationalisation and the student voice, pp. 18-29, (2010); Byram Michael, From foreign language education to education for intercultural citizenship: Essays and reflections, (2008); Byram Michael, Conceptualizing intercultural (communicative) competence and intercultural citizenship, The Routledge handbook of language and intercultural communication, pp. 85-97, (2012); Byram Michael, Golubeva Irina, Han Hui, Wagner Manuela, From principles to practice in education for intercultural citizenship, (2017); Dearden Julie, English as a medium of instruction-A growing global phenomenon, (2014); Dewey Martin, Towards a post-normative approach: Learning the pedagogy of ELF, Journal of English as a Lingua Franca, 1, pp. 141-170, (2012); Fang Fan, Baker Will, A more inclusive mind towards the world': English language teaching and study abroad in China from intercultural citizenship and English as a lingua franca perspectives, Language Teaching Research, 22, 5, pp. 608-624, (2018); Fang Fan, Baker Will, Implementing a critical pedagogy of Global Englishes in ELT from the lens of EMI and intercultural citizenship, Bloomsbury World Englishes: Pedagogies, 3, 3, pp. 177-191, (2021); Galloway Nicola, Rose Heath, English medium instruction and the English language practitioner, ELT Journal, 75, 1, pp. 33-41, (2021); (2015); Jackson Jane, Intercultural journeys: From study to residence abroad, (2010); Jackson Jane, Cultivating cosmopolitan, intercultural citizenship through critical reflection and international, experiential learning, Language and Intercultural Communication, 11, 2, pp. 80-96, (2011); Jenkins Jennifer, English as a Lingua Franca in the international university.

With the engagement of a sheer number of platform users (experienced, novel, or citizen developers) these platforms generate invaluable data and that can be considered as user metadata actions. As cloud-based development solutions provide novice users with a new development experience (performing data actions that altogether leads to a successful software app), users often times face with uncertainty about development performance; how good or complete is app development? Thus, the issue addressed in this research is how to measure user performance by using digital trace data generated on the cloud platform from a Network Science perspective. This research proposes a novel approach to leveraging digital trace data on Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) from a Network Science perspective. The proposed approach considers the importance of digital trace data as metadata actions on PaaS and introduces a network model (so-called Metadata Action Network), which is claimed to be the result of reconstruction of events of developer’s actions. We show suitability of the proposed approach to better understanding of real-world digital trace data on PaaS solution and elaborate basic performance analytics on a PaaS solution with research and practical implications. © 2020, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Analytics; Cloud computing; Development performance; Digital trace data; Network science; PaaS","Application programs; Information systems; Information use; Metadata; Software architecture; Software design; Cloud platforms; Development environment; Development experiences; Development performance; Development solutions; Model driven architectures; Network modeling; User performance; Platform as a Service (PaaS)","","","","","Armbrust M., Fox A., Griffith R., Et al., A view of cloud computing, Commun.

To address this gap, this qualitative interview study 1) explores the perceptions of Thai and Chinese students enrolled in English-medium education programs on the development of intercultural citizenship and 2) identifies links between intercultural citizenship and English for students studying in international universities. The findings reveal that the participants generally had positive attitudes toward the concept of intercultural citizenship and agreed that living in a foreign country surrounded by individuals from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds made it more effective to learn about and promote awareness of intercultural citizenship compared to staying in their homelands. They further demonstrate that English proficiency levels, exposure to teaching methods before studying abroad, and regular on-campus and off-campus activities with international friends from different linguistic-cultural backgrounds are significant in enhancing intercultural citizenship competencies. Further, some implications in terms of the promotion of intercultural citizenship education through English are also proposed and discussed.

For this purpose, fieldtrips that educate students in the real world about other stakeholders are effective, but since sustainable issues do not have clear solutions, cooperative learning (CL) in which students learn from each other is useful. The purpose of this study is to clarify the influence of the learning process on learning outcomes and their influence on learning objectives in real-world EfSD using CL. A hypothesis model consisting of seven hypotheses was set up, and a questionnaire survey of high school students who participated in the real-world EfSD was conducted. Results of the structural equation modeling of data from 2441 respondents supported all seven hypotheses. Implicit learning as a learning process promotes knowledge acquisition as a learning outcome, while explicit learning enhances self-efficacy. Although knowledge acquisition promotes citizenship development as the learning objective of EfSD, self-efficacy does not promote citizenship development. Self-efficacy affects knowledge acquisition more than implicit learning. This study contributes to EfSD research by clarifying the difference in the effects of the learning process. © 2021 by the author.

It is a great opportunity to train students to become global citizens. Developing a broader perspective and cultural competency is critically important for future social workers. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore experiences of students who participated in short study abroad programs offered as a part of the social work curriculum. Focus group interviews with eight students identified two themes: 1) cultural exposure and 2) personal and professional growth. Students reported that they were able to adopt changes, improve their ability to understand and relate to a new culture and population, and learned new perspectives. They also expressed that participating in a study abroad program helped them reflect on themselves and their own background, which are critical components of cultural competence. The study findings indicate that study abroad programs offer a valuable opportunity to enhance skills that are necessary to become a competent social worker. © 2023 Common Ground Research Networks.

This meta-ethnographic study uses conceptual tools from democratic theory and the research on civic education to investigate how leaders in one market-based organization—charter schools—grapple with tensions between the market and democracy in fostering the democratic orientations of their students and parents. Findings reveal that charter leaders primarily facilitate democratic learning opportunities that advance their organizational interests and promote a narrow and more individualistic conceptualization of democracy at the expense of a communitarian, justice-oriented one. The bounded vision of democracy observed in charter school practices suggests that market pressures may drive charters to focus their democratic engagement on the instrumental aims of ensuring their organizational survival in a competitive educational marketplace, despite espoused commitments to broader democratic aims. © The Author(s) 2020.","charter schools; democratic engagement; market-based reform","","","","","","Amrein-Beardsley A., Methodological concerns about the education value-added assessment system, Educational Researcher, 37, 2, pp. 65-75, (2008); Apple M.W., Beane J., The case for democratic schools, Democratic schools: Lessons in powerful education, pp. 1-12, (2007); Ayers W., Hunt J.A., Quinn T., Teaching for social justice: A democracy and education reader, (1998); Baldridge B.J., Beck N., Medina J.C., Reeves M.A., Toward a new understanding of community-based education: The role of community-based educational spaces in disrupting inequality for minoritized youth, Review of Research in Education, 41, 1, pp. 381-402, (2017); Baquedano-Lopez P., Alexander R.A., Hernandez S.J., Equity issues in parental and community involvement in schools: What teacher educators need to know, Review of Research in Education, 37, 1, pp. 149-182, (2013); Becker H.J., Nakagawa K., Corwin R.G., Parent involvement contracts in California’s charter schools: Strategy for educational improvement or method of exclusion?, Teachers College Record, 98, pp. 511-536, (1997); Bennett W.L., Wells C., Rank A., Young citizens and civic learning: Two paradigms of citizenship in the digital age, Citizenship Studies, 13, 2, pp. 105-120, (2009); Ben-Porath S., Deferring virtue: The new management of students and the civic role of schools, Theory and Research in Education, 11, 2, pp. 111-128, (2013); Berliner D., Rational responses to high stakes testing: The case of curriculum narrowing and the harm that follows, Cambridge Journal of Education, 41, 3, pp. 287-302, (2011); Booher-Jennings J., Below the bubble: “Educational triage” and the Texas accountability system, American Educational Research Journal, 42, 2, pp. 231-268, (2005); Bowen G.A., Document analysis as a qualitative research method, Qualitative Research Journal, 9, 2, pp. 27-40, (2009); Budde R., Education by charter: Restructuring school districts: Key to long-term continuing improvement in American education, (1988); Bulkley K.E., Henig J.R., Levin H., Between public and private: Politics, governance, and the new portfolio models for urban school reform, (2010); Buras K., Race, charter schools, and conscious capitalism: On the spatial politics of whiteness as property (and the unconscionable assault on Black New Orleans), Harvard Educational Review, 81, 2, pp. 296-331, (2011); Burch P., Hidden markets: The new education privatization, (2009); Butin D.W., Justice-learning: Service-learning as justice-oriented education, Equity & Excellence in Education, 40, 2, pp. 177-183, (2007); Chambers S., Deliberative democratic theory, Annual Review of Political Science, 6, 1, pp. 307-326, (2003); Chong S., Resource and Remaking: Organizational Mediation of Parent-School Relationships, (2018); Chubb J.E., Moe T.M., Politics, markets, and America’s schools, (1990); Creswell J.W., Educational research: Planning, conducting, and evaluating quantitative and qualitative research, (2012); Cucchiara M.B., Horvat E.M., Perils and promises: Middle-class parental involvement in urban schools, American Educational Research Journal, 46, 4, pp. 974-1004, (2009); DeBray E., Scott J., Lubienski C., Jabbar H., Intermediary organizations in charter school policy coalitions: Evidence from New Orleans, Educational Policy, 28, 2, pp. 175-206, (2014); Delanty G., Communitarianism and citizenship, Handbook of citizenship studies, pp. 161-174, (2002); Demaine J., Entwistle H., Beyond communitarianism: Citizenship, politics and education, (2016); Dewey J., Democracy and education, (1916); DiMartino C., Jessen S.B., School brand management: The policies, practices, and perceptions of branding and marketing in New York City’s public high schools, Urban Education, 51, pp. 447-475, (2016); DiMartino C., Scott J., Private sector contracting and democratic accountability, Educational Policy, 27, 2, pp. 307-333, (2013); DuBois W.E.B., Penguin classics: The souls of black folk, (1903); Duggan L., The twilight of equality?

Design/methodology/approach: This paper offers a systematic literature review of 408 papers to find models of sustainable development goals (SDGs) interaction with the aim of shedding light on the existing synergies and trade-offs and finding solutions to enhance these synergies and minimize the trade-offs. Findings: Both rich and developing countries should follow multiple strategies to improve the quality of life of their citizens. Developing countries should focus on eradicating poverty. Rich countries should apply new economic models that are more likely to be environmental-friendly. Finally, the topic of SDGs should be revisited by the United Nations. Practical implications: Boosting the quality of education and providing clean energy are two of the most relevant actions that should to be taken by countries, as they will accelerate the fulfilment of all the other SDGs. The use of circular economic models or new business models, such as the sharing economy, is essential to the achievement of sustained economic growth without negative environmental impact. Originality/value: The paper analyzes SDG interactions and offers a critical vision of practices that countries and companies should adhere to for achieving sustainable development. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","SDG; Sustainable development; Synergies; Trade-offs","developing world; economic growth; literature review; poverty alleviation; quality of life; sustainable development; Sustainable Development Goal; trade-off","","","","","Ament J.M., Freeman R., Carbone C., Vassall A., Watts C., An empirical analysis of synergies and tradeoffs between sustainable development goals, Sustainability, 12, 20, (2020); Boar A., Oliveras-Villanueva M., Systematic literature review: sustainability practices in start-ups, European Accounting and Management Review, 6, 1, pp. 53-80, (2019); Boar A., Bastida R., Marimon F., A systematic literature review.

In order to obtain the consent of the population, mass schooling tends to produce graduates who accept this illusion because they are vulnerable to these strategies and cannot imagine a post-capitalist world. However, through education, people can better appreciate the problematic reality of unbridled capitalism, such as the degradation of the global ecosystem. It is argued here that programs which are designed to address these problems, such as Education for Sustainable Development (ESD), are dependent upon citizens developing a critical consciousness. This consciousness is firstly able to confront the four strategies maintaining capitalism’s dominance. It is argued that an education which engages with spiritual ideals and values regarding how a good life is understood in an aspirational sense, enables people to engage with the dominance of capitalism and to envision other possibilities for society in which capitalism is harnessed to serve the greater public good. This requires education’s ontology–as the character of students–to critically read the world, imagine possibilities which can constitute a good life, and are courageous to enact the social actions required to make these ideals a reality.

New technologies and paradigms are emerging to support the development of software and systems. Their proliferation not only leads to higher complexity of potential solutions, but also to the problem of finding qualified people. Especially enterprises, which are constantly confronted with this problem, are increasingly considering low-code development platforms (LCDP) to allow the development of software by inexperienced and untrained citizen developers. However, at this point, non-functional requirements, such as performance and security, can require a thorough system understanding. In this work, we identify issues that may occur when citizen developers use LCDPs, allowing to deduce success factors for their implementation. Eventually, this shall help decision makers when introducing LCDPs into their environments.

Economic hardship and social inequality, as well as intergroup and racial conflict, have been identified as important contributing factors to this phenomenon known as “affective polarization.” Research shows that partisan animosities are exacerbated when these interests and identities become aligned with existing party cleavages. In this paper, we use a model of cultural evolution to study how these forces combine to generate and maintain affective political polarization. We show that economic events can drive both affective polarization and the sorting of group identities along party lines, which, in turn, can magnify the effects of underlying inequality between those groups. But, on a more optimistic note, we show that sufficiently high levels of wealth redistribution through the provision of public goods can counteract this feedback and limit the rise of polarization. We test some of our key theoretical predictions using survey data on intergroup polarization, sorting of racial groups, and affective polarization in the United States over the past 50 y. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

Less clear is to what extent such trust evaluations are generalized or specific for the three main political arenas in the European multilevel governance system (EU, national, local). With new data from the Netherlands, we demonstrate that trust in local, national and EU governments (1) is largely level-specific (i.e. is based on citizens’ perceptions of incumbents at a particular governance level) (2) and—at all three levels—is explained by level-specific political factors. This shows that political trust is a subjectively rational evaluation and that citizens develop meaningful political orientations vis-à-vis governments at different levels. Therefore, trust spillovers may be less relevant for explaining political trust in multilevel governance than assumed in previous research as executive governments at local, national and EU levels are judged “on their own turf”. © 2021, The Author(s).","European Union; Evaluation; Institutional trust; Local politics; Multilevel governance; Political trust","","","","","","Anderson C.J., When in doubt, use proxies: Attitudes toward domestic politics and support for European integration, Comparative Political Studies, 31, pp. 569-601, (1998); Anderson C.D., Economic voting and multilevel governance: A comparative individual-level analysis, American Journal of Political Science, 50, pp. 449-463, (2006); Andeweg R.B., Irwin G.A., Governance and politics of the Netherlands, (2009); Armingeon K., Ceka B., The loss of trust in the European Union during the great recession since 2007: The role of heuristics from the national political system, European Union Politics, 15, pp. 82-107, (2014); Armingeon K., Guthmann K., Democracy in crisis?

Most citizenship curricula focus on the acquisition of knowledge and the cultivation of skills and attitudes. Citizenship-related self-efficacy beliefs are often neglected in the literature on citizenship education, although they appear to play a crucial role in learning processes, among others as explanatory factors for the inequalities between students in different educational tracks. As such, studies on the development of citizenship-related self-efficacy beliefs have the potential to inform practice in a way that fosters greater equality of opportunity. However, as the literature on civic and political self-efficacy uses different dimensions and conceptualizations, this poses challenges to both the scientific accumulation of knowledge and translation to teaching practices. Here, we analyse the conceptual challenges and propose a framework for the study of self-efficacy in citizenship education research that incorporates social and political tasks of citizens and distinguishes the variety of communities in which citizens perform those tasks on two axes, namely formality and size. In doing so, we argue for fine-grained distinctions based on context instead of the all-encompassing notions of civic and political self-efficacy political theorists appear to prefer. We end by discussion two normative issues. © The Author(s) 2022.","Citizenship education; civic efficacy; collective efficacy; political efficacy; self-efficacy","","","","","","Abramson P.R., Political Attitudes in America: Formation and Change, (1983); Kranendonk M., Mulder L., Thijs P., Et al., De ontwikkeling van democratische kernwaarden, (2019); Ardevol-Abreu A., Gil D., Zuniga H., Gamez E., The influence of conspiracy beliefs on conventional and unconventional forms of political participation: The mediating role of political efficacy, British Journal of Social Psychology, 59, 2, pp. 549-569, (2020); Arthur J., Bailey R., Schools and Community, (2000); Bandura A., Self-efficacy: Toward a unifying theory of behavioral change, Psychological Review, 84, 2, pp. 191-215, (1977); Bandura A., Self-efficacy mechanism in human agency, American Psychologist, 37, 2, pp. 122-147, (1982); Bandura A., Human agency in social cognitive theory, American Psychologist, 44, 9, (1989); Bandura A., Self-Efficacy: The Exercise of Control, (1997); Bandura A., Exercise of human agency through collective efficacy, Current Directions in Psychological Science, 9, 3, pp. 75-78, (2000); Beaumont E., Political agency and empowerment: Pathways for developing a sense of political efficacy in young adults, Handbook of Research on Civic Engagement in Youth, pp. 525-558, (2010); Bellah R., Madsen R., Sullivan W., Et al., Habits of the Heart.

The resulting application is a product of two separate engineering phases without proper coordination and communication facilities between them. In these applications, inconsistencies emerge because of model/data co-evolution, e.g., the data model changes while running instances of the application are in use. Low-code platforms typically lack proper metamodeling facilities, and as a consequence, state-of-The-Art multi-view and multi-paradigm inconsistency management techniques fall short of adequately addressing inconsistencies. We propose an approach for managing multi-Artifact consistency to address inconsistencies in low-code applications properly.

Although children, as novel citizens, develop some of their skills (such as social, mental, and educational skills) in the city, many children face some kind of city exclusion. Therefore, the way the physical environment of their city is shaped and how children interact with it plays a principal role in child engagement. A child-friendly city can be a place to engage children using contemporary tools such as augmented reality (AR), which helps children communicate better and fosters abilities such as spatial cognition and physical and social skills in the physical and digital world. This study explores various examples and analyses the child-friendly city features of each. This article presents AR and its capabilities as a potential tool utilized in the city to pave the way toward a child-friendly mediated city – an inclusive social urban environment where children play or spend their leisure time and effectively mature into adulthood. © 2022 Urban Planning Institute of the Republic of Slovenia.

Modelling by the use of domain-specific languages (DSLs) has lowered the entry barrier to this activity to domain experts and citizen developers. At the same time, we are witnessing constant improvements in the capabilities of mobile devices, like augmented reality (AR) based on their camera. AR could be exploited in modelling scenarios that require locating virtual objects in the surrounding physical space. In this vision paper, we explore the use of DSLs with AR syntax, and propose the automated synthesis of mobile modelling environments for them. This opens the door to novel scenarios for domain-specific modelling in areas like interior design, Industry 4.0, domotics, tourism and transportation, among others. We propose a design process founded on Software Language Engineering principles, provide prototype tool support, and identify open challenges for the community.  © 2021 IEEE.","Augmented Reality; Domain-Specific Languages; Modelling; Software Language Engineering","Architectural design; Modeling languages; Problem oriented languages; Software prototyping; Constant improvement; Domain experts; Domain-specific modelling; Language engineering; Modeling; Modeling environments; Software and systems engineerings; Software language engineering; Software languages; Virtual objects; Augmented reality","","","","","UML 2.5.1 OMG Specification, (2017); Kelly S., Tolvanen J., Domain-specific Modeling-Enabling Full Code Generation, (2008); Voelter M., Benz S., Dietrich C., Engelmann B., Helander M., Kats L.C.L., Visser E., Wachsmuth G., DSL engineering-designing, implementing and using domain-specific languages, Dslbook.org, (2013); Mernik M., Heering J., Sloane A.M., When and how to develop domain-specific languages, ACM Comput.

In this paper, we propose a method that can investigate the history of every project in the SCP. Introducing the concept of project as a city, we consider every project in the SCP as a city, where a government and citizens develop a city through collaborative activities. We then identify essential attributes that characterize a state of a city. For each attribute, we develop metrics that quantity the state S(p, t) of a project p at time t. An experimental evaluation investigating GitHub projects of famous code editors shows that the proposed metrics well visualize the history of the projects from essential perspectives of a city. © 2019 IEEE.","governance; project measurement; smart city; social coding; software evolution; software metrics","Artificial intelligence; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Smart city; Code editors; Coding platform; Collaborative activities; Experimental evaluation; governance; social coding; Software Evolution; Software metrics; Software engineering","","","","","Trockman A., Zhou S., Kastner C., Vasilescu B., Adding sparkle to social coding: An empirical study of repository badges in the npm ecosystem, Proceedings of the 40th International Conference on Software Engineering, ICSE '18, pp. 511-522, (2018); GitHub: The World's Leading Software Development Platform; Bitbucket: The Git Solution for Professional Teams; Lehman M.M., Programs, life cycles, and laws of software evolution, Proceedings of the IEEE, 68, pp. 1060-1076, (1980); Matsumoto K., Hata H., Nakamura M., Tamada H., Ihara A., Morisaki S., Tsunoda M., Toda K., Ohira M., Monden A., Development of fundamental technologies to accelerate spontaneous software evolution, JSPS Kakenhi Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (A) JP17H00731, (2017); Visual Studio Code; Nakamura M., Du Bousquet L., Constructing execution and lifecycle models for smart city services with self-aware IoT, IEEE 12th International Conference on Autonomic Computing (ICAC2015), pp. 289-294, (2015); Atom: The Hackable Text Editor; An Open Source Code Editor for the Web, Written in JavaScript, HTML and CSS; GraphQL API v4; (2018); Dinwiddie G., Feel the burn, getting the most out of burn charts, Better Software, 11, 9, pp. 26-31, (2009); Gousios G., Pinzger M., Deursen V.A., An exploratory study of the pull-based software development model, Proceedings of the 36th International Conference on Software Engineering, ICSE 2014, (New York, NY, USA), pp. 345-355, (2014); Steinmacher I., Pinto G., Wiese I.S., Gerosa M.A., Almost there: A study on quasi-contributors in open-source software projects, 2018 IEEE/ACM 40th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE), pp. 256-266, (2018); Yang X., Yoshida N., Kula R.G., Iida H., Peer review social network (peRSoN) in open source projects, IEICE Transactions on Information and Systems, E99-D, 3, pp. 661-670, (2016); Constantinou E., Mens T., Socio-technical evolution of the ruby ecosystem in github, 2017 IEEE 24th International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution and Reengineering (SANER), pp. 34-44, (2017); Pinto G., Steinmacher I., Gerosa M.A., More common than you think: An in-depth study of casual contributors, 2016 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution, and Reengineering (SANER), 1, pp. 112-123, (2016); Borges H., Hora A., Valente M.T., Understanding the factors that impact the popularity of github repositories, 2016 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME), pp. 334-344, (2016)","","Nakamura M.; Hirata H.; Ito T.; Otsuka T.; Okuhara S.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Computer Society; Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE); International Association for Computer and Information Science (ACIS)","20th IEEE/ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing, SNPD 2019","8 July 2019 through 11 July 2019","Toyama","156157","","978-172811651-8","","","English","Proc. - IEEE/ACIS Int.

In Sons al Balcó, the research activities cohabit with the dynamic collaboration with citizens and other stakeholders to create social and environmental impact, to widen awareness and design tools to improve citizenship development and empowerment. The initial scientific hypothesis is that the annoyance coming from outdoor noise, minimized by the lockdown effect, could be associated with better perception of the soundscape by people. Sons al Balcó allows validating this hypothesis in two different ways. On the one hand, by means of subjective questionnaires conducted to people living in pre-defined diverse acoustic areas (urban, suburban and rural environments), and on the other hand, by the use of objective measurements of the noise levels, and the study of the soundscape in these areas, using short pieces of video collected by citizens. For this purpose, we designed an on line test to be conducted by any citizen aiming to contribute to this wide study for all the territory of Catalonia, both from rural areas and from cities. A communication campaign was conducted to reach a significant participation. During the lockdown, more than 350 questionnaires and videos were collected, and a first map of the soundscape of the confinement in Catalonia was depicted. © 2020 by the authors.","lockdown; perception; soundscape; suburban; urban","","","","","","Blanes N., Fons J., Houthuijs D., Swart W., de la Maza M., Ramos M., Castell N., van Kempen E., Noise in Europe 2017: Updated Assessment, (2017); Aletta F., Oberman T., Mitchell A., Tong H., Kang J., Assessing the changing urban sound environment during the COVID-19 lockdown period using short-term acoustic measurements, Noise Mapp, 7, pp. 123-134, (2020); Basu B., Murphy E., Molter A., Basu A.S., Sannigrahi S., Belmonte M., Pilla F., Effect of COVID-19 on noise pollution change in Dublin, Ireland, arXiv, (2020); Asensio C., Aumond P., Can A., Gasco L., Lercher P., Wunderli J.M., Lavandier C., de Arcas G., Ribeiro C., Munoz P., Et al., A Taxonomy Proposal for the Assessment of the Changes in Soundscape Resulting from the COVID-19 Lockdown, Int.

The DC is particularly important in forming university students and future teachers. This article presents the main results of a study to evaluate DC and its relationship with the socioeconomic level of first-year students of pedagogy in three Chilean public universities, located in the north, center, and south of the country. A quantitative research methodology was used, with a sample of 817 students, the data were collected through the DIGCOMP-PED evaluation instrument, which evaluates DC development using the DIGCOMP framework. The results were analyzed at the general and socioeconomic level on the variables of the educational establishment where they attended high school and the territorial area of the university they attended. The main results indicate that the level of DC achievement is intermediate, the areas with the highest levels of achievement were “network security” and “online communication and collaboration.” On the other hand, the lowest levels of achievement were reached in the areas “information and digital literacy,” “digital content creation,” and “problem solving.” The level of DC is higher among students of private establishments and those who attend universities located in the central area. © 2022, The Author(s).","Educational quality; Higher education; ICT; New literacy; Quantitative analysis; University students","","","","","","National assessment program e ICT literacy years 6 & 10 report 2011, Assessment and Reporting Authority, (2012); Aguaded I., Cabero J., Tecnologías y medios para la educación en la e-sociedad, (2013); Araneda-Guirriman C., Sallan J.G., Pedraja-Rejas L., Rodriguez-Ponce E., Percepciones sobre el perfil del estudiante universitario en el contexto de la educación superior de masas: Aproximaciones desde Chile, Interciencia, 43, 12, pp. 864-870, (2018); Barrientos-Oradini N., Araya-Castillo L., Educación Superior en Chile: Una visión sistémica.

Results show large negative effects across many dimensions. The article highlights how the relationship between government and citizens developed during the pandemic and underlines some vulnerabilities of Moldovan society which were also present before COVID-19, but intensified during the crisis. Due to COVID-19, 41,5% of Moldovans have changed their lifestyle and 88,4% argue that their situation is worst due to the fact that the pandemic crisis deepened the previous social, political and economic crises of the country. Finally, 35.4% of respondents point out to quite high levels of inefficient communication as well as contradictory information of governmental institutions and 75,5% consider there is a persisting lack of transparency in governmental communication during the pandemic crisis.

It fills the gap between business and IT by supporting the active involvement of non-technical domain experts, named Citizen Developer, in the application development lifecycle. Low-code introduces new concepts and characteristics. However, it is not investigated yet in academic research to point out the existing challenges and opportunities when testing low-code software. This shortage of resources motivates this research to provide an explicit definition to this area that we call it Low-Code Testing. In this paper, we initially conduct an analysis of the testing components of five commercial Low-Code Development Platforms (LCDP) to present low-code testing advancements from a business point of view. Based on the low-code principles as well as the result of our analysis, we propose a feature list for low-code testing along with possible values for them. This feature list can be used as a baseline for comparing low-code testing components and as a guideline for building new ones. Accordingly, we specify the status of the testing components of investigated LCDPs based on the proposed features. Finally, the challenges of low-code testing are introduced considering three concerns: the role of citizen developer in testing, the need for high-level test automation, and cloud testing. We provide references to the state-of-the-art to specify the difficulties and opportunities from an academic perspective. The results of this research can be used as a starting point for future research in low-code testing area.  © 2020 ACM.","Citizen developer; Low-code; Low-code development platform; Testing","Life cycle; Well testing; Academic research; Application development; Code development; Code principle; Development approach; Domain experts; State of the art; Test Automation; Software testing","","","","","Bernardino M., Rodrigues E.M., Zorzo A.F., Marchezan L., Systematic mapping study on MBT: Tools and models, Iet Software, 11, 4, pp. 141-155, (2017); Bertolino A., De Angelis G., Gallego M., Garcia B., Gortazar F., Lonetti F., Marchetti E., A systematic review on cloud testing, Comput.

Previous studies have suggested that Japanese citizens have been strongly opposed to the idea of nuclear armament. However, this study questions the robustness of the anti-nuclear stance among the Japanese population. More specifically, I contend that ethnocentric tendencies among Japanese citizens significantly boost their support for nuclear armament. The statistical analysis relying on the survey data in Japan verifies this hypothesis. Findings from this study are essential in understanding the current discourse surrounding nuclear armament in Japan. Dissecting the process through which Japanese citizens develop their attitudes toward nuclear weapons, this study significantly advances our understanding of Japan’s identity issues in the security arena. © The Author(s) 2020.","ethnocentrism; Japan; nuclear armament","","","","","","Allison G., Destined for War: Can America and China Escape Thucydides’ Trap?, (2017); Barkan S., Cohn S., Racial prejudice and support by whites for police use of force: A research note, Justice Quarterly, 15, 4, pp. 743-753, (1998); Bar-Tal D., Causes and consequences of delegitimization: Models of conflict and ethnocentrism, Journal of Social Issues, 46, 1, pp. 65-81, (1990); Trump Kim summit: US and North Korean leaders hold historic talks. 12 June, (2018); Beckley M., China’s century?

We first identify three normative functions that public spheres are expected to perform in representative democracies: they provide voice to alternative perspectives, they empower citizens to criticise political authorities and they disseminate information on matters of public interest. We then argue that citizens develop differentiated views about the importance of these democratic functions, depending on (1) their ability to influence political decisions through public debate, and (2) the extent to which voice, critique and information address democratic problems they particularly care about. Drawing on Wave 6 of the European Social Survey, the statistical analysis indicates that citizens in most European countries consider the public sphere very important for democracy, especially its role as a supplier of reliable information. However, certain groups tend to care more about different aspects of the public sphere. More educated citizens are more likely to assign greater importance to all three functions. Members of cultural and sexual minorities are more likely to emphasise the importance of giving voice to alternative perspectives, while citizens dissatisfied with the government are more likely to prioritise public criticism and access to reliable information. Finally, in countries with more democratic public spheres, differences based on education and minority status are wider, while differences based on government satisfaction disappear. These findings support the claim that citizens care more about the public sphere when they can effectively influence political decision making through public debate or when the public sphere addresses democratic problems that are especially important to them. Moreover, our results indicate that citizens see some of the functions that public spheres perform as core aspects of democracy, comparable in importance to free and fair elections and the rule of law. The article thus advances an empirically grounded defence of the centrality of public debate for democracy. © 2021 The Authors.

To overcome this problem and to have solution on tip of finger low code development platforms are developed. These platforms help enterprises to create their own business applications in very less time because it offers drag and drop interfaces and blocks of pre-build modules which minimize handwritten code. Low Code Development Platforms (LCDP) are capable to develop general-purpose, process-based, database, request handling, and mobile-based applications. In response, low code development platforms are growing in popularity to speed up the productivity and delivery of required applications. It makes development easier so that even people without programming skills (i.e. Citizen Developers) can develop applications on their own. The low code programming is based on different approaches like visual modeling, model-driven development, rapid application development and automatic code generation. Because of all these features, LCDP enables organizations to build their own apps by configuring the functions instead of coding the software from scratch. In this paper, we are going to understand limitation of present platforms/techniques from various papers and identify that scope of improvement. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Citizen developer; Drag and drop interfaces; Low code; Pre-build modules","","","","","","Waszkowski R., Low-code platform for automating business processes in manufacturing, IFAC Pap.

Therefore, companies based on a Domain-Driven approach lose a lot of human resources trying to satisfy these demands. This resulted in a significant evolution on two standards: (i) The software architecture that recently embodied in Microservices Architecture and (ii) the development techniques, which have recently been personified in the No-Code/Low-Code movement that leading by Domain-Driven development and Model Driven Architecture. In this paper, we analyze the source code of 50 microservice-based projects using 50 different ideas to present the current state of the microservices architecture. Then, we propose a new approach for integrating the microservice architecture with the emerging Low-Code development trend to create a platform that makes it simple and quick for programmers and even citizen developers to develop, test, and deploy applications. By using a new Microservice-Specific Language, we achieved encouraging results we optimaze up to 95.81% of hard-coding. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Low-Code; Microservices Architecture; Model Driven Architecture; No-Code; Software engineering","Software design; Desktop applications; Information society; Low-code; Microservice architecture; Mobile applications; Model driven architectures; No-code; Specific languages; WEB application; Web applications; Software architecture","","","","","Hailpern P., Tarr P., Model-driven development: the good, the bad, and the ugly, IBM Syst.

Although there are many projects operated by active communities performing spontaneous evolution, it is yet unclear that how such successful projects and communities have been formed and governed. This article proposes a method that can investigate the history of every project in the SCP. Introducing the concept of project as a city, the authors consider every project in the SCP as a city, where a government and citizens develop a city through collaborative activities. This research then identifies essential attributes that characterize a state of a city. For each attribute, the authors develop metrics that quantify the state S(p; t) of a project p at time t. An experimental evaluation investigating GitHub projects of famous code editors shows that the proposed metrics well visualize the history of the projects from essential perspectives of a city. © 2020 International Journal of Software Innovation.","Governance; Project Measurement; Smart City; Social Coding; Software Evolution; Software Metrics","","","","","","Brackets, (2012); Bitbucket, (2008); Borges H., Hora A., Valente M.T., Understanding the factors that impact the popularity of github repositories, Proceedings of the 2016 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME), pp. 334-344, (2016); Constantinou E., Mens T., Socio-technical evolution of the ruby ecosystem in github, Proceedings of the 2017 IEEE 24th International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution and Reengineering (SANER), pp. 34-44, (2017); Dinwiddie G., Feel the burn, getting the most out of burn charts, Better Software, 11, 9, pp. 26-31, (2009); Github, (2008); Atom, (2014); GraphQL API v4, (2017); Gousios G., Pinzger M., Deursen A.V., An exploratory study of the pull-based software development model, Proceedings of the 36th International Conference on Software Engineering, pp. 345-355, (2014); Graph Q.L., GraphQL, (2018); Lehman M.M., Programs, life cycles, and laws of software evolution, Proceedings of the IEEE, 68, 9, pp. 1060-1076, (1980); Nakamura M.K., Tamada H., Ihara A., Morisaki S., Monden A., Development of fundamental technologies to accelerate spontaneous software evolution, JSPS Kakenhi Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (A) JP17H00731, (2017); Visual Studio Code, (2015); Nakamura M., Du Bousquet L., Constructing execution and life-cycle models for smart city services with self-Aware iot, Proceedings of the IEEE 12th International Conference on Autonomic Computing (ICAC2015), pp. 289-294, (2015); Pinto G., Steinmacher I., Gerosa M.A., More common than you think: An in-depth study of casual contributors, Proceedings of the 2016 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution, and Reengineering (Saner), 1, pp. 112-123, (2016); Steinmacher I., Pinto G., Wiese I.S., Gerosa M.A., Almost there: A study on quasi-contributors in open-source software projects, Proceedings of the 2018 IEEE/ACM 40th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE), pp. 256-266, (2018); Trockman A., Zhou S., Kastner C., Vasilescu B., Adding sparkle to social coding: An empirical study of repository badges in the npm ecosystem, Proceedings of the 40th International Conference on Software Engineering, pp. 511-522, (2018); Yang X., Yoshida N., Kula R.G., Iida H., 3).

Low-code principles allow enterprises to save time and costs through a more rapid development pace and to improve software products quality by bringing closer together business and information technologies as well as promoting automation. Nevertheless, the low-code/no-code approach is a relatively new and continuously progressing domain that requires understanding of existing challenges and identification of improvement directions. In this paper, challenges in the low-code software development process and suggestions for their mitigation are identified and amalgamated with the purpose to deliver insights into the current state of the low-code/no-code development process and identify areas for further research and development. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Citizen developer; Low-code; Low-code development platform; No-code; Requirements; Software development","Computer programming; Citizen developer; Code development; Code principle; Development platform; Literature reviews; Low-code; Low-code development platform; Manual coding; No-code; Requirement; Software design","","","","","Al Alamin M.A., Et al., An empirical study of developer discussions on low-code software development challenges, Proceedings – 2021 IEEE/ACM 18Th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories, MSR 2021.

Divergent from traditional silo-based, discipline specific models, this broad and complex challenge necessitates the continued investigation of innovative interdisciplinary approaches for engineering and construction education. The 360 degree model for educating socially responsible global citizens developed by the authors (360 Global Ed model) addresses these current needs through a structured approach for developing students as global citizens through purposeful engagement. The 360 Global Ed model includes a theoretical framework, educational environment, academic coursework, and evidence-based outcomes. At the core of the model is an international service learning (ISL) experience. The model's ISL component provides a collaborative, interdisciplinary classroom environment combined with an authentic international field experience. Six years of a mix-methods research assessment demonstrate the 360 Global Ed model's outstanding results on the impact of student learning in the areas of global citizenship, personal and professional growth, and cultural intelligence. Additionally, over this period, the authors have also observed positive impacts on the host-country participants of the ISL component. This paper provides a background on the need for globalization, social responsibility and service learning in engineering and construction management education, reviews the 360 Global Ed model for educating socially responsible global citizens, and discusses assessment results on the impact of student learning and host-country teacher perceptions on the challenges and benefits of participating in the ISL program. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","","Economic and social effects; Education computing; Learning systems; Occupational risks; Personnel; Project management; Safety engineering; Social aspects; Students; Classroom environment; Construction engineering; Construction management education; Educational environment; Engineering and construction education; International service learning; Social responsibilities; Theoretical framework; Engineering education","","","","","Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Programs, (2011); Astin A.W., Vogelgesan L.J., Ikeda E.K., Yee J.A., How Service Learning Affects Students, Higher Education Research, (2000); Borg J.P., Zitomer D.H., Dual-team model for international service learning in engineering; Remote solar water pumping in Guatemala, Journal of Professional Issues in Engineering Education and Practice, 134, 2, pp. 178-185, (2008); Breitkreuz K., Songer A.D., The emerging 360 degree model for global citizenship education, International Journal of Research on Service-Learning and Community Engagement, 3, 1, (2015); AMERICA 21: A New Approach to the 21st Century Workforce, (2008); Innovate america: Thriving in a world of challenge and change, The National Innovation Initiative, (2005); Academic Assessments, 2015, (2015); Davies L., Global citizenship; Abstraction or framework for action?, Educational Review, 58, 1, pp. 5-25, (2006); Deardorff D.K., Identification and assessment of intercultural competence as a student outcome of internationalization, Journal of Studies in International Education, 10, 3, pp. 241-266, (2006); Dunderstatt J., Engineering for A Changing World: The Millennium Project, (2008); Feisman A., Wittig J., Milnes J., Baxter A., Moreau J., Mehta K., Validation process of a social entrepreneurial telemedicine venture in east Africa, International Journal for Service Learning in Engineering, 5, 1, pp. 1-24, (2010); Green M., Acting As Global Citizens: A Challenge to U.

The main challenge of sustainable development is the problem of waste management and recycling. To promote long-term sustainability, it is crucial to equip youth with contemporary knowledge and skills and to change their daily habits. The Circular Economy (CE) has become a key concept in responding to unsustainable resource use and waste management globally. At the same time, Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) education is an innovative teaching approach to promote learners’ capacity for self-direction, problem-solving, collaboration, and management. This paper argues the role of STEM education in connecting science with society, the benefits of teaching CE in promoting sustainable consumption and production behaviors, and the potential integration of CE into STEM education through real-world context inquiry and real-world problem-solving. It also presents the case of Vietnam, where integration of STEM education and CE in secondary schools is crucial for a CE toward sustainable development. Questionnaire surveys with 873 secondary school teachers and semi-structured interviews with 54 were conducted during the integrated STEM professional trainings. The aims were to examine teachers’ perspectives on the relevance of STEM education and CE to sustainable development and their behaviors toward integrating CE concepts into daily STEM teaching activities. The findings showed a high perception of STEM teachers on the relevance of CE with STEM teaching, the Vietnam context, its interestingness, and the importance of integrating CE into STEM education. Surveyed teachers have also voluntarily integrated development issues and CE principles into STEM teaching. Including CE in STEM education in secondary education offers a promising opportunity to foster more profound societal change toward sustainable development, which contributes to SDG4 — equitable and quality education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles and SDG 12.5 — reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling, and reuse.

The process may be supported by personal resources like personal values and critical thinking dispositions. With this study on 536 young students’ students aged 18 to 26 (M = 20.85, SD = 1.60), we analysed the relationship between two adjacent personal values, universalism and self-direction, and students’ digital citizenship. Moreover, we examined the role of critical thinking dispositions, namely learning orientation, and cognitive integrity in supporting digital citizenship development. Following structural equation modelling (SEM) analyses, the results show that universalism and learning orientation significantly positively influence digital citizenship, whereas cognitive integrity has a negative effect. Further, personal values positively associate with critical thinking dispositions.

We considered these ‘maximalist’ forms of participation – ‘multi-sited’, as the language of democratic theory suggests, in both the political sphere of art and the formal arena of politics – as ways of doing, acting, and performing citizenship in democratic societies. Drawing upon the ‘cultural turn’ in citizenship studies, we assumed civic cultures as central variables to explain these forms of political agency. Referring to media audience research, we adopted an analytical framework to explore the artists’ civic cultures that are in action in public urban spaces. The analysis focused on performances of citizenship developed in Sardinia (Italy). The research shed light on the artists’ knowledge and values, the multiple layers of audience participation envisaged in their practices of communication, their (dis)trust towards institutions and non-elite actors in civil society, and the civic identities they perform in contemporary societies. © The Author(s) 2019.","audience studies; citizenship; civic cultures; political participation; public art","","","","","","Abercrombie N., Longhurst B.J., Audiences: A Sociological Theory of Performance and Imagination, (1998); Bakardjieva M., The internet and subactivism: Cultivating young citizenship in everyday life, Young People, ICTs and Democracy: Theories, Policies, Identities, and Websites, pp. 129-146, (2010); Bauman Z., In Search of Politics, (1999); Bennett W.L., Segerberg A., The Logic of Connective Action: Digital Media and the Personalization of Contentious Politics, (2013); Bhabha H.K., The Location of Culture, (1994); Bishop C., Participation, (2006); Boal A., The Theatre of the Oppressed, (1979); Bourriaud N., Relational Aesthetics, (2002); Carpentier N., Media and Participation: A Site of Ideological-democratic Struggle, (2011); Carpentier N., Dahlgren P., Pasquali F., Waves of media democratization: A brief history of contemporary participatory practices in the media sphere, Convergence, 19, 3, pp. 287-294, (2013); Castells M., Communication Power, (2009); Couldry N., Why Voice Matters: Culture and Politics after Neoliberalism, (2010); Dahlgren P., Television and the Public Sphere: Citizenship, Democracy and the Media, (1995); Dahlgren P., Media and Political Engagement: Citizens, Communication and Democracy, (2009); de Certeau M., The Practice of Everyday Life, (2011); Dery M., Culture Jamming: Hacking, Slashing and Sniping in the Empire of Signs, (1993); Dezeuze A., The ‘Do-It-Yourself’ Artwork: Participation from Fluxus to New Media, (2010); Duncombe S., Dream: Re-imagining Progressive Politics in an Age of Fantasy, (2007); Fiske J., Understanding Popular Culture, (1989); Fraser N., Rethinking the public sphere: A contribution to the critique of actually existing democracy, Social Text, 26, pp. 56-80, (1990); Gablik S., Connective aesthetics, American Art, 6, 2, pp. 2-7, (1992); Giddens A., Runaway World: How Globalization is Reshaping our Lives, (2002); Habermas J., The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere, (1989); Hall S., Encoding/decoding in television discourse, Culture, Media, Language, pp. 128-138, (1980); Harvey D., Rebel Cities: From the Right to the City to the Urban Revolution, (2012); Iannelli L., Ripensare la partecipazione politica, tra grammatiche pop e siti di social network, Public Screens: La politica tra narrazioni mediali e agire partecipativo, pp. 195-225, (2014); Iannelli L., Hybrid Politics: Media and Participation, (2016); Iannelli L., Marelli C.M., Cultures in action: Public art and political participation, Performative Citizenship: Public Art, Urban Design and Political Participation, pp. 51-71, (2017); Iannelli L., Musaro P., Performative Citizenship: Public Art, Urban Design and Political Participation, (2017); Isin E.F., Nielsen G.M., Acts of Citizenship, (2008); La partecipazione politica in Italia, (2014); Jacob M.J., Brenson M., Olson E.M., Culture in Action: A Public Art Program of Sculpture Chicago, (1995); Jenkins H., Ford S., Green J., Spreadable Media: Creating Value and Meaning in a Networked Culture, (2013); Kester G., Conversation pieces: The role of dialogue in socially engaged art, Theory in Contemporary Art Since 1985, pp. 76-100, (2005); Kwon M., One Place after Another: Site-specific Art and Locational Identity, (2004); Lacy S., Mapping the Terrain: New Genre Public Art, (1995); Lane M.B., Public participation in planning: An intellectual history, Australian Geographer, 36, 3, pp. 283-299, (2005); Lievrouw L., Alternative and Activist New Media, (2011); Livingstone S., On the relation between audiences and publics, Audiences and Publics: When Cultural Engagement Matters for the Public Sphere.

Models are specified through domain-specific languages and consumed by dedicated model management services, which implement automation and analysis services. Achieving complex model-driven tasks that involve several model management services and multiple model repositories can be a difficult and error-prone task. For instance, modelers have to identify the proper atomic operations among available services, connect to remote model repositories, and figure out their composition to satisfy the final goal. Different composition proposals have been introduced in MDE even though a satisfactory solution is still missing. In this paper, we propose a low-code development environment to support citizen developers to plan, organize, specify and execute model-management workflows underpinning the development of complex systems. Thus, developers are relieved from managing low-level details, e.g., related to the discovery, orchestration, and integration of the needed model management services. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Cloud-based model repository; Domain specific language; Low-code development platform; Production system development; Workflow engine","Artificial intelligence; Industrial management; Problem oriented languages; Development solutions; Digital transformation; Domain specific languages; Model repositories; Model-driven Engineering; Multiple-modeling; Production system; Satisfactory solutions; Environmental management","","","","","Baruah B., Dhal S., A two-factor authentication scheme against FDM attack in IFTTT based smart home system, Comput.

Our approach, informed by Critical Language Awareness (CLA) theory, engages students with both unfamiliar and familiar linguistic forms, in order to promote critical reflection on ‘self’ and ‘other’, a crucial component of global citizenship development in higher education. We draw on our experience teaching cross- and intra-linguistic variation in linguistics courses, using a curricular sequence that involves three central concepts: Descriptivism, Indexicality, and Language Ideology. Through this sequence, students become more aware of their implicit biases and learn to argue against pervasive linguistic stereotypes and misconceptions. We reference examples of student work and comments from course evaluations showing how students internalise and apply course learning. This study adds to the growing body of research on how CLA is taught and learned within the higher education curriculum.

In so doing, a conceptual model is put forward to address citizenry development, extending beyond an informed scientific and technological decision making ability and encompassing constructive activities addressing sustainable development at the local, national and global level. The operationalisation of the model builds on an initial student-relevant, societal issue-related contextualisation involving STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) while focusing on developing science conceptual learning. The model extends to not only considering socio-scientific issues, but seeks to promote trans-contextualisation beyond the school setting, seeking to raise awareness of an active informed citizenry, related to environmental, economic and social sustainability. The components of active informed citizenry are described and a trans-contextual science teaching example based on the model is put forward in this article. © 2020 by the authors.","Active informed citizenry; Education for sustainable development (ESD); Global citizenship; Science education; Trans-contextualisation","conceptual framework; decision making; education; learning; socioeconomic conditions; student; sustainable development; teaching; United Nations","","","","","UNESCO; Transforming OurWorld: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, (2015); Schulz R.M., Reforming Science Education: Part I, The Search for A.

To support the widespread adoption and use of SPAs, organizations such as Google or Amazon provide low code environments that support the development of SPAs (e.g., for Google Home or Amazon’s Alexa). These so-called low code platforms enable domain experts (e.g., business users without programming skills or experience) to develop SPAs for their purposes. However, using these platforms alone does not guarantee a useful and good conversation with novel SPAs due to non-intuitive design choices. Following a design science research approach, we propose the Smart Personal Assistant for Domain Experts (SPADE) method to address the missing link. This method supports domain experts in the development and contextualization of sophisticated SPAs for various application scenarios and focuses especially on conversational and anthropomorphic design steps. Our proof of concept and proof of value results show that SPADE is useful for supporting domain experts to create effective SPAs in different domains beyond private set-ups. © 2023 The Author(s).

Unethical activities have led to stakeholder losses, with no accountability by individuals perpetuating the fraud. Corporate governance frameworks and subsequent reforms have been used merely as tick box measures, proving them inefficient in numerous corporate collapses. This study intends to explore and analyse the roles of personal and collective virtues in corporate citizenship. Developing from the virtues theory and using a mixed method of three focus group discussions and a self-administered questionnaire of 119 participants from various organisations, the authors establish that personal virtues are important to portray ethical individualism. However, in a corporate setting, collective virtues are more important to enhance corporate citizenship, through ethical culture and collective accountability. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Collective virtues; Corporate citizenship; Malaysia; Normative ethics; Personal virtues; Stakeholders","","","","","","Abdullah W.M.T.W., Daud S., Hanapiyah Z.M., Human governance and corruption risk in Malaysia public sector, Global Business & Management Research, 12, 4, pp. 721-731, (2020); Al Halbusi H., Tang T.L.P., Williams K.A., Et al., Do ethical leaders enhance employee ethical behaviors?, Asian J Bus Ethics, 11, pp. 105-135, (2022); Al-Jabari B., Ghazzawi I., Organisational commitment: A review of the conceptual and empirical literature and a research agenda, International Leadership Journal, 11, 1, pp. 78-119, (2019); Alrawi H., Mosteanu N.R., Alrawi I.H., Control environment, risk assessment and monitoring in United Arab Emirates Businesses, Creative Business and Social Innovations for a Sustainable Future, pp. 55-65, (2019); Alsaadi A., Jaafar A., Ebrahim M.S., Corporate social responsibility, Shariah-compliant and earnings management, In Seventh Asia Pacific Interdisciplinary Research in Accounting Conference, 44, pp. 1-45, (2013); Asaduzzaman M., Virtanen P., Governance theories and models.

Furthermore, as many schools are characterized by superdiversity, especially in bigger cities (Crul et al., 2013), there is also a need for research on media education and diversity. This article presents the findings of the research project INCLUDED, a participatory action research about media education in a secondary school in Germany. The project aims to analyse the everyday media use of young people with diverse cultural backgrounds living in a socio‐economically disadvantaged neighbourhood and co‐develop teaching modules on media literacy education integrating an intercultural perspective. The fieldwork of the project (January 2020–April 2021) included participatory observations (online and offline), teacher interviews, and focus groups with the students (13–15 years). The article will particularly focus on one teaching module that focused on TikTok and Instagram influencers. The students’ presenta-tions in the classroom demonstrated how the diverse cultural backgrounds of the students also shaped the content that they consumed on social media. Analysing this teaching module as an example, this article discusses the benefits and challenges of designing a more inclusive and participatory approach to media education in the context of culturally diverse schools as an alternative to culture‐blindness and over‐emphasis of cultural differences. © 2022 by the author(s);.","diversity; inclusion; influencers; Instagram; media education; media literacy; migrants; social media; TikTok; youth","","","","","","Aufderheide P., Aspen Media Literacy Conference report—Part II: Procedings and next steps, (1992); Bevort E., Verniers P., The appropriation of new media and communication tools by young people aged 12–18 in Europe, Empowerment through media education: An intercul-tural dialogue, pp. 89-100, (2008); Bozdag C., Digital inclusion through distribu-tion of iPads during the Covid19 pandemic?

Conflicts between the interests of environmental protection and the needs of socio-economic development become particularly acute when large areas of land are taken out of economic circulation as a result of organizing protected areas. In this case, there is an urgent need for detailed and reliable information about the social impacts of such land withdrawal on the well-being of the local population. An analysis of the methodological approaches widely presented in the literature, used to assess the social impact of protected areas, testifies to the insufficiency of completed and practically applicable methodological guidelines for the areas with significant restrictions for people who form part of the protected landscape. In this study, we understand the cost estimate of the social impact of national parks on the local population as a quantitative calculation of the losses due to restrictions on their ownership rights to land and property assets. The methodological approach consists in considering the category of losses as a sum total of the actual damage and lost profits. The assessment algorithm includes three stages: systematization of social impacts on citizens, development of indicators and data collection, and calculation of actual damage to the population and lost profits. The assessment is performed using the example of the Tunkinsky National Park located in the Tunkinsky municipal district of the Republic of Buryatia, a region of the Russian Federation, where there are 14 rural settlements with a population of more than 20,000 people. The results of the calculations show that the losses of the rural population due to legal restrictions on the registration of land dealings amount to 170.4 million USD. Taking into account the potential amount of administrative fines and the value of property subject to demolition, the losses amount to 239.2 million USD. It is more than an order of magnitude greater than the amount of own revenues of the Tunkinsky municipal district in 2011–2019. The results obtained demonstrate the real picture of the impact of restrictions on the rights of local people to land within the boundaries of national parks and are useful for developing measures to account for their interests and include protected areas in the socio-economic development of regions. The methodological approach developed by the authors can be used in other national parks, where it is necessary to optimize the policy of improving land use for local residents. © 2021 Maksanova et al.

At the same time, the increasing prevalence of low-code development platforms (LCDP) allows organizations to introduce citizen development initiatives to promote and accelerate their digital transformations. Citizen development represents a novel software engineering paradigm which enables and supports the development of software by non-IT professionals, consequently referred to as ‘citizen developers’. While there is a vivid discourse on citizen development in the practice community, research on this phenomenon is still scarce. We conducted a systematic multivocal literature review including research and practice publications, and identified six key themes: 1) definition and characteristics of citizen development, 2) enablers and expected benefits of citizen development, 3) challenges of and criticism towards citizen development, 4) citizen development strategy and implementation, 5) citizen development governance, and 6) citizen developers’ profiles and skills. Moreover, we propose a research agenda for future work on citizen development. Our research contribution is to synthesize the existing knowledge on citizen development and to point out future avenues to propel research on this emerging and contemporary phenomenon. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Citizen developer; Citizen development; Low-code development platforms; Multivocal literature review; Technology democratization","Codes (symbols); Engineering research; Citizen developer; Citizen development; Code development; Development platform; Digital transformation; Literature reviews; Low-code development platform; Multivocal literature review; Research agenda; Technology democratization; Software design","","","","","Hoogsteen D., Borgman H., Empower the workforce, empower the company? citizen development adoption, Proceedings of the 55th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, pp. 4717-4726, (2022); Matt C., Hess T., Benlian A., Et al., Options for formulating a digital transformation strategy, MIS Q.

The methodological basis of the study was formed by the provisions terms of the concepts of the Global citizenship education (UNESCO) program and the Russian Federal project ""Patriotic education for the citizens of the Russian Federation 2021-2024"", as well as the system-activity and competence-based approaches. As the principal research method, we applied the comparative analysis of recent scientific literature on the problem of the citizenship formation and the citizenship education implementation. The results of the study. The study of international social and educational practice made it possible to distinguish the following features of the citizenship competence development: the transition from readiness to activity itself; the encouragement of initiative, individuality and equality in a society; the assistance to young people in active participation in the life of a society, not in the ""foreseeable future"", but now; education for global citizenship and democracy; the study and implementation of human rights and duties; cross-cultural dialogue and multiculturalism, social action and responsibility. In the Russian research and educational discourse, we distinguish the following issues: psychological determinants of the citizenship formation of a personality; citizenship as an integral trait of a person; civic-patriotic attitudes representation in young people's minds, value orientations and patriotic self-determination. Discussion and conclusion. The presented review through the comparative analysis on the problem of the citizenship formation and the citizenship education implementation enabled us to specify the citizenship competence structure, taking into account the most effective international social and educational practices. The structure of citizenship competence consists of the following interrelated components, reflecting promising avenues in the framework of citizenship education: legal, political, cultural and historical, socio-communicative, environmental-geographical and health-preserving. © 2022 Perspectives of Science & Education.

Increasingly shut out of the formal political realm, they adopted creative measures to exert their political will, including participating in the world's fair. Employing insights from settler-colonial theory and public history, this paper argues that the politics of display expanded the agency of a group marginalized from political representation. The U.S. government, pressured by the territory's growing population of non-Native settlers, had begun planning for statehood, passing the 1898 Curtis Act to force allotment and dissolve the Five Tribes' governments by 1906. To protect their land and sovereignty, a cohort of Native citizens pursued statehood for Indian Territory separate from Oklahoma Territory. Although joint statehood won out, separate statehood advocates succeeded in creating exhibits that centered on the survival of Native nations. They also articulated an Indigenous conception of citizenship, developing an imaginative vision for a future in which self-determination and U.S. citizenship could converge in a Native state. This represented a novel contribution to ongoing debates over how to integrate remaining western territories into the United States and how to incorporate diverse peoples within the citizenry.  © 2023 The Author(s).

This paper aims to describe the development of health citizenship from the post-colonial until the democratization era in Indonesia by analyzing health accessibility. The social-history approach was applied to analyze contemporary study in Indonesian healthcare access from 1945 to 2020. This article analyses the dynamic over political regime changes context and its approach to deal with health accessibility based on acceptability, availability, and affordability issues. This study found that each political regime provides a different social-political context in prioritizing and administrating the accessibility of healthcare. Besides each regime appears issues of accessibility, all of which provoke inequity in healthcare. This paper argues that health citizenship development in Indonesia shows the underlying cause of inequity. Consequently, the minimal presence of public participation raises inequity. Inequity leads to healthcare access that provides pointless improvement. Narratives in health citizenship fulfillment call for public participation space in administering access to healthcare. © 2021 The Author(s).","Access; Health citizenship; Healthcare","","","","","","Agustina R., Dartanto T., Sitompul R., Susiloretni K.

Then, the identified features were integrated into the ODEON (Open Data Exchange solutiON) tool and its effectiveness in facilitating interaction between stakeholders was demonstrated through an evaluation with 22 stakeholders. This paper contributes to theory by proposing a list of 16 requirements to be implemented into a tool to facilitate communication between OGD stakeholders. Second, it contributes to practice by proposing a use case diagram listing the features needed to satisfy the requirements and a usable tool implementing them. © 2022, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Communication; OGD stakeholders; Open government data; Requirements","Digital storage; e-government; Open Data; Exchanges platforms; Literature reviews; Open data exchange; Open government data; Open government data stakeholder; Requirement; Technical aspects; Use cases diagrams; Electronic data interchange","","","","","Attard J., Orlandi F., Scerri S., Auer S., A systematic review of open government data initiatives, Gov.

The search for solutions to these and other problems on the way to sustainable development necessarily involves a better understanding of the Earth system and its dynamics. The Earth system is composed of five highly dependent and interrelated subsystems that exchange matter and energy. This notion is at the base of what in the literature is named Earth System Science (ESS). Humanity has been profoundly altering the dynamics of this system, leading to the proposal of a new geological epoch—the Anthropocene. Developing a holistic understanding of the complex and tangled relationships between subsystems and the role of human impacts is the target of study of Earth System Education (ESE). With the assumptions of ESS, ESE is emerging as a new approach in science education. Based on a deep knowledge of the planet and the development of specific competencies, such as system thinking, it is possible to perform more actively and consciously in the relationships that citizens develop with the Earth system, enabling the existence of a more viable future for humanity. © 2021 by the authors.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the teacher candidates’ development of social and emotional learning through their international teaching experiences. Design/methodology/approach: The study is framed by Critical Cosmopolitan Theory, which is a theoretical lens for a critical understanding of the development of global competencies for critical consciousness. The paper uses a case study research design (Yin, 2008), which included data collected via artifact analysis, participant interviews and participant observation through field notes. Findings: The study found how the study abroad and international teaching experiences were instrumental in aiding in the teacher candidates’ social and emotional learning. This included the adoption of culturally responsive teaching practices, development of reading the world and enactment of taking action to rewrite the world. Research limitations/implications: One of the limitations is the relatively small sample size. This is due, in part, to the high cost associated with study abroad. The high cost of study abroad can be a barrier for students to access the cross-cultural experiences afforded by study abroad. The hefty price tag of study abroad often limits the number of teacher candidates at public institutions who can go on study abroad (Malewski and Phillion, 2009). A future research agenda is needed about ways to help off-set the costs in order to make study abroad more affordable and equitable. Practical implications: The practical implications of this paper are that it provides an instructive lens for how to integrate social and emotional learning within a study abroad experience. At the same time, the paper connects socio-emotional learning (SEL) with the development of global competencies and global citizenship. Social implications: The social implications relate to the practical implications in that the paper illustrates how SEL is connected to the development of global citizenship development. The study weds the critical cosmopolitan framework with SEL to show how learners develop empathy through reading and rewriting the world. Originality/value: The case study presented in this paper highlights the possibilities of study abroad in tandem with international teaching experiences to help prepare teachers with SEL features like fostering empathy, developing culturally responsive practices, and becoming critically conscious and cosmopolitan. The study fills a gap in the literature regarding the development of SEL among elementary education teacher candidates through study abroad and international teaching experiences. © 2019, Erik Jon Byker.","Critical cosmopolitan theory;

To this end, we applied a qualitative methodology through the study of four cases, four museums in the city of Bologna, selected for their good practices in educational programmes for schools. Instruments such as interviews, observation, and documentary analysis were used. The results emphasise a close school-museum relationship, with heritage as an agent that enhances people’s identity, a fundamental element in the citizenship development of Bolognese society, and a key aspect for the development of inclusive principles and the care of all people, although improvements in the processes and some limitations in the development of the programmes are perceived. The outcomes highlight the importance of school and museum relations and the development of an inclusive heritage education that advocates a holistic, integrative, and complex approach to heritage, as an essential element in the development of the individual and of society. © 2020 by the authors.

These software products range from small business applications to large business platforms, around which software ecosystems increasingly form. In these software ecosystems, different organizations want to extend the created software products with services and software, with the goal of creating active enterprise networks that create value collaboratively. Well designed and maintained application programming interfaces are crucial for these organizations. In this paper we evaluate the application programming interface management maturity of four low-code development platforms. We show that these platform providers are not yet concerned with helping their customers build software ecosystems around the software platforms that citizen developers create. Furthermore, we identify the software engineering research challenges that these platform providers face. For instance, low-code development platforms should create abstractions that let citizen developers design, develop, and manage application programming interfaces. If low-code development platform providers follow our advice and act on it, they will become able to provide customers with complete ecosystem-enabled platforms instead of providing only simple throwaway business applications. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","API management; Citizen software development; Low-code; Model-driven development","Application programming interfaces (API); Ecosystems; Systems analysis; Business applications; Code development; Engineering knowledge; Enterprise networks; Management maturities; Software ecosystems; Software platforms; Software products; Application programs","","","","","de Bruin T., Rosemann M., Freeze R., Kulkarni U., Understanding the main phases of developing a maturity assessment model, ACIS 2005 Proceedings-16Th Australasian Conference on Information Systems, (2005); Cabot J., Positioning of the low-code movement within the field of model-driven engineering, Proceedings-23Rd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems, MODELS-C 2020-Companion Proceedings, Pp. 535–537, (2020); Hora A., Robbes R., Valente M.T., Anquetil N., Etien A., Ducasse S., How do developers react to API evolution?

There needs to be more than the traditional centralized IT operational model to meet the dynamic needs of the industry. This has led to new models, such as the citizen developer program, which enables business users to create and deploy applications without requiring specialized technical skills. The citizen developer program is a new approach allowing non-IT professionals to create applications for their business needs using low-code and no-code platforms. This program aims to decentralize IT operations, increase innovation, reduce costs, and enhance customer experience. The democratization of technology is the core concept behind the citizen developer program, which enables businesses to create their applications and automate their processes [1]. The implementation of a citizen developer program requires careful planning and consideration of various factors, including change management, awareness and marketing of the concept, training, selecting the correct low code no code tool, management buy-in, building a community of practices for citizen developers, governance/policy, and more. These elements are critical to the program's success and must be carefully considered during implementation. This manuscript provides a framework for implementing a citizen developer program in the oil and gas industry. It also includes a case study of implementing such a program and creating significant value in Kuwait Integrated Petroleum Industries Company (KIPIC). The Framework emphasizes the importance of change management, awareness and marketing of the concept, training, selecting the correct low code no code tool, management buy-in, building a community of practices for citizen developers, governance/policy, and more. The manuscript aims to provide insights into the benefits of implementing a citizen developer program in the oil and gas industry and its potential impact on the IT operational model. In summary, the citizen developer program represents a paradigm shift in the oil and gas industry, which enables businesses to create and deploy applications without relying solely on IT professionals. This program can increase innovation, reduce costs, and enhance customer experience. The implementation of a citizen developer program requires careful planning and consideration of various factors, as outlined in this manuscript.

Global citizenry emerged as a two-factor construct that was related to social orientation, self-relevant goals, political attitudes, and actual experience with diversity. Moreover, it was distinct from previous attempts to capture cosmopolitanism; cognitive orientation, more generally; and self-presentational concerns. As a tentative first step toward scale development of global citizenship, the present findings suggest that although being a world citizen may not necessarily involve traveling the world, it does promote lower social dominance, greater existential quest, more liberal political attitudes, and greater experience in multicultural contexts. © 2019 American Psychological Association","diversity; global identity; political orientation; social dominance","","","","","","Appiah K.

Likewise, the Eurozone arguably depends on some form of a fiscal union. This international redistribution critically depends on citizens’ support. Do politically knowledgeable citizens develop preferences for fiscal redistribution that are different from those of ignorant citizens? Based on the 2014 European Election Study, this article argues that knowledge plays a limited and conditional role. It hardly exerts a systematic independent effect. Rather, it helps crystallize party cues and basic European integration values. My findings are consistent with a theory, according to which knowledge eases the process of rationalizing preferences that originate in previous basic orientations. © The Author(s) 2020.","Eurozone; fiscal union; political knowledge; solidarity","","","","","","Abadie A., Diamond A., Hainmueller J., Comparative politics and the synthetic control method, American Journal of Political Science, 59, 2, pp. 495-510, (2015); Achen C.H., Bartels L.M., Democracy for Realists.

Understanding and evaluating the LCDP to be employed for the particular problem at hand are difficult tasks mainly because decision-makers have to choose among hundreds of heterogeneous platforms, which are difficult to evaluate without dedicated support. Thus, a detailed classification is needed to elaborate on the existing low-code platforms and to help users find out the most appropriate platforms based on their requirements.In this paper, a technical survey of different LCDPs is presented by relying on a proposed conceptual comparative framework. In particular, by analyzing eight representative LCDPs, a corresponding set of features have been identified to distil the functionalities and the services that each considered platform can support. The final aim is facilitating the understanding and the comparison of the low-code platforms that can best accommodate given user requirements.  © 2020 IEEE.","Low-Code Development Platforms; Model Driven Engineering; Software Development","Decision making; Code development; Decision makers; Detailed classification; Heterogeneous platforms; Software systems; User requirements; Visual environments; Application programs","","","","","Basciani F., Rocco J., Di Ruscio D., Di Salle A., Iovino L., Pierantonio A., Mdeforge: An Extensible Webbased Modeling Platform.

Specifically, the paper discusses how: Experiential simulation-based learning strategies such as Operator Training Simulators have become more mobile, on-demand and collaborative in order to drive more personalized worker experiences AI infused microlearning tailored to industrial operations staff is used to build upon an individual's learning profile, identify strengths and weaknesses and provide timely reinforcement learning content Virtual Reality platforms can be used to address behavioral needs, where frontline staff can be trained and evaluated on decision-making and real-time choices when faced with unexpected or infrequent situations in the simulated plant. Using real-life scenarios, these solutions can help instill responsible behavior and boost safety performance across both assets and teams Microsoft Power Apps now allow citizen development of solutions by those closest to the opportunity. The age of mass personalization within an Industry 5.0 world is here and will undoubtedly seeks to achieve large-scale impact, one individual at a time. © 2021 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

Depending on the political and social ideologies within and across societies, different citizenship education curricula are designed differently to achieve these goals. This article uses the cases of Australia and Singapore to discuss how different forms of citizenship education can contribute to an ongoing construction of a more just and peaceful world. Through the analysis of the social science curricula in the two countries, three key factors that can influence the value of democratic citizenship education in developing ‘active’ and ‘informed’ citizens were identified. First, the extent to which democratic values are referenced as the basis for citizenship, hence supporting an understanding of ‘politics’ in contexts of diversity. Second, the balance to be sought between development of competencies to achieve nationalistic goals and responding effectively to the dynamism of contemporary societies. Third, the extent to which curriculum arrangements support democratic citizenship development. © 2021 Intellect Ltd.","Citizenship education; Comparative and crosscultural education; Curriculum and pedagogy; Democratic education; Humanities education; Inclusive education; Primary education; Teacher education","","","","","","Civics and citizenship, (2016); Baildon M., Alviar-Martin T., Issues-centred global citizenship education in Asia: Curricular challenges and possibilities in nation-centric and neoliberal times, Curriculum Perspectives, 36, 2, pp. 65-75, (2016); Banks J., Diversity and citizenship education in global times, SAGE Handbook of Education for Citizenship and Democracy, pp. 57-70, (2008); Banks J., Diversity and citizenship education in multicultural nations, Routledge International Handbook of Multicultural Education Research in Asia Pacific, pp. 1-28, (2018); Banks J., Transforming citizenship education in global societies, Visioning Multicultural Education: Past, Present, Future, (2021); History K-10 syllabus, (2012); Bosio E., Torres C.

Human rights research among disabled individuals is relatively new and along with it, the call for citizenship development in the same demographic is just being initiated. The aim of this study is to investigate the key role of sports activities participation in the promotion of citizenship among disabled individuals. A descriptive study design was implemented using a survey which was adapted to collect data from a sample of 50 participants. A total of 50 participants in a group of special needs with the age of 15-44 years old participated in the study. As for the results, the participants performed moderate levels on the study variables (citizenship and sport participation). The results also illustrated that there were no significant differences on the study variables based on the participants gender and age groups. Added to this, the results showed that there was a significant relationship between sport participation and citizenship dimensions such as active, semi and passive citizenship. The study results extended literature concerning sport activities participation and citizenship behavior and provided evidence to the sport participation role in boosting citizenship. Based on the results, the study recommended to organize several sport activities among individual with special needs in order to help them to engage in the community as well as to improve their citizenship levels.

A six-week virtual exchange is explored with students from universities in Mexico, Poland, Spain, and the USA. This study utilizes five key elements of CALL-related tasks and three categories of telecollaborative tasks in order to promote students’ global citizenship, defined as awareness, caring, and embracing cultural diversity while promoting social justice and sustainability, coupled with a sense of responsibility to act. During the exchange, 55 participants, registered for foreign language courses (English or Spanish) or for a content area course (such as business and pedagogy) taught in English, met weekly in groups via Zoom video conferencing. In addition to discussing weekly topics, via selected current event photos, and using either English or Spanish as a LF, participants completed individual weekly pre- and post-Zoom session activities. Qualitative analyses revealed that weekly topics offered opportunities to problem solve, negotiate ideologies, and make connections to participants’ belief systems. Also, results indicated that participants became more socially responsible as shown by their increased citizenship awareness and civic-mindfulness. © The Author(s) 2019.","global citizenship; lingua franca; synchronous computer-mediated communication; task design; virtual exchange","","","","","","Akiyama Y., Cunningham D.J., Synthesizing the practice of SCMC-based telecollaboration: A scoping review, CALICO Journal, 35, pp. 49-76, (2018); Bohinski C.A., Leventhal Y., Rethinking the ICC framework: Transformation and telecollaboration, Foreign Language Annals, 48, pp. 521-534, (2015); Bohinski C.A., Mule N., Telecollaboration: Participation and negotiation of meaning in synchronous and asynchronous activities, MEXTESOL Journal, 40, 3, pp. 1-16, (2016); Bouchard J., Ideology, agency, and intercultural communicative competence: A stratified look into EFL education in Japan, (2017); Branon R.F., Essex C., Synchronous and asynchronous communication tools in distance education, TechTrends, 45, pp. 36-42, (2001); Byram M., From foreign language education to education for intercultural citizenship: Essays and reflections: Volume 17, (2008); Byram M., Conceptualizing intercultural (communicative) competence and intercultural citizenship, The Routledge handbook of language and intercultural communication, pp. 85-97, (2012); Chen N., Ko H., Kinshuk, Lin T., A model for synchronous learning using the Internet, Innovations in Education and Teaching International, 42, pp. 181-194, (2005); Collier M.J., Intercultural communication competence: Continuing challenges and critical directions, International Journal of Intercultural Relations, 48, pp. 9-11, (2015); Competences for democratic culture: Living together as equals in culturally diverse democratic societies, (2016); Ciftci E.Y., Savas P., The role of telecollaboration in language and intercultural learning: A synthesis of studies published between 2010 and 2015, ReCALL, 30, pp. 278-298, (2018); De Wit H., Hunter F., Jones E., Leask B., Advancing global citizenship through internationalisation in higher education: Definitions, models, challenges and practices: A literature review, (2013); Dooly M., Telecollaboration, The handbook of technology and second language teaching and learning, pp. 169-183, (2017); Dorner H., Exploring students’ conceptions of internationalised learning: Experiences from international online collaborative seminars, Innovations in Education and Teaching International, 55, pp. 304-313, (2016); El-Hariri Y., Learner perspectives on task design for oral–visual eTandem language learning, Innovation in Language Learning and Teaching, 10, pp. 49-72, (2016); What is virtual exchange?, (2018); Fuchs C., Hauck M., Muller-Hartmann A., Promoting learner autonomy through multiliteracy skills development in cross-institutional exchanges, Language Learning & Technology, 16, pp. 82-102, (2012); Godwin-Jones R., Emerging technologies the evolving roles of language teachers: Trained coders, local researchers, global citizens, Language, Learning & Technology, 19, pp. 10-22, (2015); Gonzalez-Lloret M., Designing task-based call to promote interaction: En busca de esmeraldas, Language Learning & Technology, 7, pp. 86-104, (2003); Gonzalez-Lloret M., Ortega L., Towards technology-mediated TBLT: An introduction, Technology-mediated TBLT: Researching technology and tasks: Volume 6, pp. 1-22, (2014); Guarda M., Negotiating a transcultural place in an English as a lingua franca telecollaboration exchange: A mixed methods approach to the analysis of intercultural communicative competence and third space in an online Community of Practice, (2013); Guth S., Helm F., Developing multiliteracies in ELT through telecollaboration, ELT Journal, 66, pp. 42-51, (2011); Hartwiger A., Moore A.S., Cross-cultural negotiations of human rights in literature and visual culture, Globally networked teaching in the humanities, pp. 156-168, (2015); Helm F., Guth S., Farrah M., Promoting dialogue or hegemonic practice?

In effect with the digital transformation due to the COVID-19 pandemic we are witnessing an ever-increasing demand of the application development in a relatively short time. To this is added the lack of skilled developers on constantly evolving technologies. We therefore offer a low-code platform for the automatic generation of client web applications, regardless of the platform or framework chosen. First, we defined an interface design methodology based on a portal. We then implemented our model driven architecture which consisted of defining a modeling and templating language, centered on user data, flexible enough to not only be used in various fields but also be easily used by a citizen developer. © 2022.

Thus, companies aim for a more efficient development of more effective applications since domain experts as so-called citizen developers are no longer limited by the availability and domain knowledge of trained software developers. Nevertheless, efficiency and effectiveness of application development is traditionally also largely influenced by the use of a suitable software development method. Domain experts are, however, not trained in software development methods. This introduces a risk of domain experts creating unusable applications or exceeding the designated time frame of a project (or both). In this paper, we therefore propose an initial version of a situational software development method which supports domain experts in manufacturing companies during the low-code development of applications. The method can be tailored based on situational factors, considering application requirements, features of the used low-code development platform, and characteristics of the development team. We also present feedback corroborating the usefulness of our method and future extension points based on expert interviews. © 2022 ACM.","end-user development; low-code; software development method","Application programs; Domain Knowledge; Manufacture; Application development; Code development; Development platform; Domain experts; Domain knowledge; End-User Development; Low-code; Manufacturing companies; Software developer; Software development methods; Software design","","","","","Awad A., Decker G., Lohmann N., Diagnosing and Repairing Data Anomalies in Process Models, Business Process Management Workshops, pp. 5-16, (2010); Rita Barricelli B., Cassano F., Fogli D., Piccinno A., End-user development, end-user programming and end-user software engineering: A systematic mapping study, Journal of Systems and Software, 149, pp. 101-137, (2019); Bekkers W., Van De Weerd I., Brinkkemper S., Mahieu A., The Influence of Situational Factors in Software Product Management: An Empirical Study, 2008 Second International Workshop on Software Product Management, pp. 41-48, (2008); Bock A.C., Frank U., Search of the Essence of Low-Code: An Exploratory Study of Seven Development Platforms, ACM/ IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems Companion.

The research design includes discourse-analysis of the social media posts reflecting the most relevant Internet risks, automated social media analysis with the special tool – software for new media monitoring (IQBuzz) and eye-tracking for destructive online content neurovisual reaction measuring (kind of neurovisual modeling of the Internet-content perception). The article covers the algorithm of tackling the Internet risks: 1) defining of the Internet risks markers; 2) identifying of the Internet risks triggers; 3) developing of recommendations for teachers and counselors to minimize Internet risks for children and young people. The prospect of the research could be the social graph analysis oriented to the identification of the destructive online group connections’ density, destructive opinion leaders’ techniques and features of the asocial users” activities.

The concept of food citizenship develops an understanding of how food systems function to ensure that individuals and communities have agency, access, and engagement with their food. It allows for comparative analysis between global/industrial and community/alternative systems. This paper follows a methodological integration between action research and a case study approach. The action research process produced a networked governance structure derived from multiple initiatives which are currently initiating many thematic projects—amongst them, a local food system. Results indicate that formalizing governance structures derived from self-organizing behavior have led to an inclusive platform with a shared vision and goals. The governing structures, however, require continued efforts and capacity to engage collaboratively in implementing their strategic plans. Findings suggest that actors developing a food citizenship-focused system should (1) consider how the governance organizational structure enables fluid communication among members and leads to building trust, (2) seek alternatives to engage youth (especially in rural areas) and promote citizen engagement, and (3) develop strategies to seek technical and programmatic support for initiatives. These three aspects are key features which may be adapted to other such efforts in sustainable and local food systems. The complex networked approach to governance presented here and the shared vision for sustainability are considered key elements in fostering a successful alternative food system with the fundamentals of food citizenship at its core. © 2021 by the authors.

Low-code development platforms can help solve these issues by using technology to empower end-users without programming background to participate in the software development process. This trend is referred to as “citizen development.” Through six case studies, this study advances our understanding of the factors that influence organizational citizen development adoption decisions. We use an extended technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework, which enhances the explanatory power of the base TOE framework. Our results show that multiple risk perceptions, active top management support, project-based business-IT alignment, centralized IT governance, and business network systems influence organizational citizen development adoption decisions. Based on the results, we discuss academic and practical implications and suggestions for future research. © 2022 IEEE Computer Society.

In high-quality information environments—where policies are transparent, the media is free, and political opposition is robust—mass perceptions closely track economic conditions. In contrast, compromised information environments provide openings for political manipulation, leading perceptions to deviate from business cycle fluctuations. We test our argument with unique data from eight Latin American countries. Results show restrictions on access to information distort the public’s view of economic performance. The ability of voters to sanction governments is stronger when democratic institutions and the media protect citizens’ access to independent, unbiased information. Our findings highlight the importance of accurate evaluations of the economy for government accountability and democratic responsiveness. © The Author(s) 2021.","accountability; consumer confidence; economic perceptions; government performance; information environment","","","","","","Achen C.H., Bartels L.M., Democracy for realists: Why elections do not produce responsive government, 4, (2017); Anderson C.J., The end of economic voting?

Recently, special attention has been paid to process-driven decision support systems (PD-DSS) in which a process model prescribes the invocation sequence of software-based decision support services and the data exchange between them. Thus, it is possible to quickly combine available decision support services as needed for optimally supporting the decision making process of an individual decision maker. However, process modelers may accidentally create a process model which is technically well-formed and executable, but contains functional and behavioral flaws such as redundant or missing services. These flaws may result in inefficient computations or invalid decision recommendations when the corresponding PD-DSS is utilized by a decision maker. In this paper, we therefore propose an approach to validate functionality and behavior of a process model representing a PD-DSS. Our approach is based on expressing flaws as anti-patterns for which the process model can be automatically checked via graph matching. We prototypically implemented our approach and demonstrate its applicability in the context of decision making for energy network planning. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Citizen development; Decision support systems; Digital ecosystem; Process model validation; Process-driven applications","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Electronic data interchange; Pattern recognition; Anti-patterns; Citizen development; Decision makers; Decision support services; Digital ecosystem; Model validation; Process model validation; Process-driven; Process-driven application; Process-models; Decision support systems","","","","","Awad A., BPMN-Q: a language to query business processes, Enterprise Modelling and Information Systems Architectures-Concepts and Applications, pp. 115-128, (2007); Awad A., Decker G., Lohmann N., Diagnosing and repairing data anomalies in process models, BPM 2009.

This has recently been conceptualised through the notion of intercultural citizenship with universities promising to equip graduates with the necessary knowledge and skills to engage in global workplaces and communities. However, the extent to which intercultural citizenship goes beyond promotion and marketing and is meaningfully incorporated into university curricula and teaching practices is still unclear. Most significantly, there is little evidence that students themselves are aware of, motivated by, or develop a sense of intercultural citizenship at international universities. In parallel to the expansion of internationalisation in HE has been an increase in English medium instruction (EMI) programmes. This link between the use of English and internationalisation is therefore likely to also influence perceptions of intercultural citizenship but has so far received little attention in research. To address these gaps this study investigated the perceptions and experiences of international students towards intercultural citizenship and its links to language before, during and after their study via interviews and a focus group. Findings showed intercultural citizenship was generally positively perceived and strongly linked to English, but reported development was uneven during study abroad. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cultural content; English medium instruction; global citizenship; Intercultural citizenship; internationalisation of higher education; study abroad","","","","","","Aktas F., Pitts K., Richards J.C., Silova I., Institutionalizing global citizenship: A critical analysis of higher education Programs and curricula, Journal of Studies in International Education, (2017); Baker W., Fang F., From English language learners to intercultural citizens: Chinese student sojourners’ development of intercultural citizenship in ELT and EMI programmes, British Council ELT Research Papers, 18, 4, (2019); Baker W., Huttner J., English and more: A multisite study of roles and conceptualisations of language in English medium multilingual universities from Europe to Asia, Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development, 38, 6, pp. 501-516, (2017); Baker W., Huttner J., “We are not the language police”: Comparing multilingual EMI programmes in Europe and Asia, International Journal of Applied Linguistics, 29, 1, pp. 78-94, (2019); Byram M., From foreign language education to education for intercultural citizenship: Essays and reflections, (2008); Byram M., Golubeva I., Han H., Wagner M., From Principles to Practice in education for intercultural citizenship, (2017); Clifford V., Montgomery C., Challenging Conceptions of western higher education and Promoting graduates as global citizens, Higher Education Quarterly, 68, 1, pp. 28-45, (2014); Dafouz E., Smit U., Towards a dynamic conceptual framework for english-medium education in multilingual university settings, Applied Linguistics, 37, 3, pp. 397-415, (2016); Dearden J., English as a medium of instruction–a growing global phenomenon, (2014); Fang F., Baker W., A more inclusive mind towards the world’: English language teaching and study abroad in China from intercultural citizenship and English as a lingua franca perspectives, Language Teaching Research, 22, 5, pp. 608-624, (2018); Han H., Song L., Ju H., Zhao Y., Exploring perceptions of intercultural citizenship among English Learners in Chinese universities, From Principles to Practice in education for intercultural citizenship, pp. 25-44, (2017); Jackson J., Education abroad, The Routledge handbook of language and intercultural communication, pp. 449-463, (2012); Jackson J., Becoming interculturally competent: Theory to practice in international education, International Journal of Intercultural Relations, 48, pp. 91-107, (2015); Jenkins J., English as a Lingua Franca in the international university.

Software applications utilized to automate business processes, boost team collaboration, and improve data visibility require extensive development time, numerous skilled developers with years of coding experience, and a significant amount of capital. Rapid application development (RAD) methodologies offer solutions to several shortcomings of traditional software development processes. They provide a unique experiential opportunity to citizen developers interested in solving industry-scale problems that traditionally require formal education in Computer Science (CS) and/or Information Technology, along with several years of professional experience. It is hypothesized that leveraging RAD benefits key stakeholders in education. This paper presents a brief literature review to de-mystify the industry before delving into a case study utilizing RAD in an educational environment. This study outlines and analyzes an eight year-long case study on the development lifecycle of a capstone design management software application. This application was first implemented using traditional application development (TRAD) by a team of IT-centric undergraduates and graduates. It was later redesigned and deployed in a low-code, public cloud environment by both Engineering and CS undergraduates. This paper compares and contrasts the development lifecycles of the TRAD and RAD renditions of the two capstone design solutions. Further analysis illustrates that leveraging RAD can supplement the student developers' educational experience and provide faculty with greater flexibility and control of course delivery and collaboration tools. Holistic evaluations of both development methods in an educational setting are described in detail. Faculty and administrators can utilize these results to evaluate the viability of RAD methodologies for their needs before making a long-term investment in a software platform. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021","","Application programs; Curricula; Education computing; Engineering education; Investments; Life cycle; Software design; Application development; Business Process; Capstone design; Case-studies; Development methodology; Educational experiences; Information technology tools; Rapid application development; Software applications; Software solution; Students","","","","","Efstratia D., Experiential Education through Project Based Learning, Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences, 152, (2014); Jariwala A.

One of the critical sources of conflict is the territorial dispute over the Senkaku Islands. The goal of this study is to examine how Japanese citizens develop policy preferences toward China in the issue of the Senkaku Islands. Regarding this matter, it is possible to suggest two scenarios. First, realist concerns among Japanese citizens will boost support for a hawkish approach against China as defending territories is one of the most important concerns for states in the international system. The second scenario prescribes that economic interdependence between Japan and China will undermine the support for a firm approach against China. This perspective is based on the idea that economic interdependence prevents states from going to war with each other. The present research examines the validity of these two competing hypotheses. Statistical analysis relying on the survey data from Japan lends support to the realist perspective. Dissecting the process through which Japanese citizens develop their policy preferences toward China, this study makes an important contribution to the literature of international relations, thus generating critical implications that are highly useful in the real world. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","China; Japan; Liberalism; Realism; Territorial disputes","China; East China Sea; Japan; Okinawa [Ryukyu Islands]; Ryukyu Islands; Senkaku Islands; economic relations; international relations; policy making; public attitude; statistical analysis; territorial dispute","","","","","Allison R., Race, Gender, and Attitudes toward War in Chicago: An International Analysis, Sociological Forum, 26, 3, pp. 668-691, (2011); Alvstam C., Strom P., Yoshino N., On the Economic Interdependence between China and Japan: Challenges and Possibilities, Asia Pacific Viewpoint, 50, 2, pp. 198-214, (2009); Angell N., The Great Illusion: A Study of the Relation of Military Power in Nations to Their Economic and Social Advantage, (1911); Aoyama R., Getting Down to Business on Japan-China Relations, East Asia Forum, (2017); Arai K., Izumikawa Y., Nihonjhin ha dono teido buryoku kousi ni maemuki nanoka?

Design/methodology/approach: This study follows the quasi-inductive approach which allows the development of pre-categories from other theories before the sampling and coding processes begin, for use in those processes. Data was extracted using relevant keywords from Twitter, and a sample was drawn from the Twitter data set to ensure the data is more manageable from a qualitative research standpoint and that meaningful interpretations can be drawn from the data analysis results. The data analysis is discussed in two parts: extraction and classification of data from Twitter using automated sentiment analysis; and qualitative data analysis of a smaller Twitter data sample. Findings: This study found that during the lockdown the majority of users on Twitter shared positive opinions towards the lockdown. The results also found that people are keeping themselves engaged and entertained. Governments around the world have also gained support from Twitter users. This is despite the hardships being faced by citizens. The authors also found a number of users expressing negative sentiments. The results also found that several users on Twitter were fence-sitters and their opinions and emotions could swing either way depending on how the pandemic progresses and what action is taken by governments around the world. Research limitations/implications: The authors add to the body of literature that has examined Twitter discussions around H1N1 using in-depth qualitative methods and conspiracy theories around COVID-19. In the long run, the government can help citizens develop routines that help the community adapt to a new dangerous environment – this has very effectively been shown in the context of wildfires in the context of disaster management. In the context of this research, the dominance of the positive themes within tweets is promising for policymakers and governments around the world. However, sentiments may wish to be monitored going forward as large-spikes in negative sentiment may highlight lockdown-fatigue. Social implications: The psychology of humans during a pandemic can have a profound impact on how COVID-19 shapes up, and this shall also include how people behave with other people and with the larger environment. Lockdowns are the opposite of what societies strive to achieve, i.e. socializing. Originality/value: This study is based on original Twitter data collected during the initial days of the COVID-19-induced lockdown. The topic of “lockdowns” and the “COVID-19” pandemic have not been studied together thus far. This study is highly topical. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Coping; COVID-19; Lockdown; Mixed-methods; Pandemic; Social media; Twitter","","","","","","Ahmed W., Bath P.A., Sbaffi L., Demartini G., Novel insights into views towards H1N1 during the 2009 pandemic: a thematic analysis of twitter data, Health Information & Libraries Journal, 36, 1, pp. 60-72, (2019);

The results point at three main strategies, which can be expected to foster a “soft” cultural change towards disaster preparedness over time: (1) encouraging measures that build upon already existing cultural values and daily routines; (2) organising preparedness-related activities that are designed as part of citizens' everyday-life events; and (3) improving perceived self-efficacy by demonstrating how citizens’ already existing, personal everyday skills can be harnessed in disaster situations. © 2021 The Author(s)","Citizen summit; Community cohesion; Culture; Disaster preparedness; Self-efficacy","","","","","","International Strategy for Disaster Reduction, (2016); Huang S.K., Lindell M.K., Prater, Who leaves and who stays?

Increasingly places are marketed as mountain biking places with supporting legal rights of access in place. However, in this study of the Cairngorms National Park in Scotland as in many places, mountain bikers are not always made very welcome on the ground by managers and other users. This disjuncture between promotion and provision of facilities and embodied experience can lead to mixed messages being received by mountain bikers and create challenges for the regulation of outdoor recreation which relies heavily on informal norms. This paper explores how this disjoint is experienced by participants on the ground and how it affects the ability of mountain biking to co-exist with more established activities, and wider ecologies. It shows that such inconsistences or a lack of welcome could come at a price for coexistence, pointing in particular to how feelings of belonging and disbelonging can work to develop constructive or destructive affective economies, which profoundly shape how boundaries of outdoor citizenship are enacted. Notably, we find that a'disengagement threshold’ can be reached when a mountain biker's experience of feeling'alien’ (‘other’ or less-than-citizen) develops into more entrenched feelings of being alienated, whereupon they give up striving for acceptance and became disconnected from informal normative agency. The paper thus re-centres emotions as crucial in understanding how outdoor recreation is regulated through the formal and informal disciplining of moving bodies, and highlights belonging as an under-acknowledged and under-utilised mechanism of management. Management implications • A sense of belonging, and associated emotional economies, are under-acknowledged and under-utilised mechanisms of outdoor recreation management. • Mountain bikers receive mixed messages regarding their welcome in the outdoors as their participation is encouraged by proponents of health and business but resisted in practice by some land managers, recreation managers and other users through social interactions and material infrastructure. • There are implications for regulating mountain biking – and any mixture of outdoor activities or participants - of creating sense of ‘insiders’ and ‘outsiders’. • Attempts to limit mountain biking – especially within the legal entitlement – can be ineffective or even have the opposite effect. • Inducing guilt or ‘feeling bad’ in such a recreationist perceived to be acting inappropriately does not necessarily lead to more appropriate behaviour. • A more overt multi-use ethic may aid co-existence and safety (e.g. walkers and mountain bikers expecting and attuned to each other). © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Affect; Citizenship; Conflict; Emotions; Outdoor recreation; Scotland","","","","","","Ahmed S., Affective economies, Social Text, 22, 2, pp. 117-139, (2004); Askins K., Pain R., Contact zones: participation, materiality, and the messiness of interaction, Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 29, 5, pp. 803-821, (2011); Bauman Z., Intimations of postmodernity, (1992); Bennett A., The post-subcultural turn: some reflections 10 years on, Journal of Youth Studies, 14, 5, pp. 493-506, (2011); Bondi L., Davidson J., Smith M., Introduction: geography's 'emotional turn’, Emotional geographies, pp. 1-16, (2007); Brown (2016).

Service learning is proving to be a successful approach to engage these active learners and empower them by using real-life applications. Students have the chance to practice what they learn in the classroom, while enhancing their citizenship, social and personal responsibility, practical, interpersonal and problem-solving skills. Service learning is an innovative learning pedagogy, which possesses the potential to improve students' knowledge and awareness about their communities, develop citizenship, as well as helping them to attain positive graduate attributes. A case study was conducted at the University of Botswana with 11 undergraduate industrial design students with one community-based organisation involved in the travel and tourism industry. The main challenge was to assist the organisation to be more visible and remain competitive by bringing their brand on-line. The findings indicate that the service learning pedagogy facilitates a reciprocal learning process between the University and the community partners. © 2016 WIETE.","Citizenship development; Community awareness; Graduate attributes; Service learning","","","","","","Baggerly J., Service learning with children affected by poverty: Facilitating multicultural competence in counseling education students, J. of Multicultural Counseling and Develop., 34, 4, pp. 244-255, (2006); Hart S., Engaging the learner: The ABC's of service-learning, Teaching and Learning in Nursing, 10, 2, pp. 76-79, (2015); Eyler J., Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?, (1999); Caruso C., Understanding y, (2014); Arenas A., Bosworth K., Kwandayi H.P., Civic service through schools: An international perspective, Compare, 36, 1, pp. 23-40, (2006); Said H., Ahmad I., Hassan Z., Awang Z., Service learning as critical pedagogy: Implications for student community awareness and citizenship development, Mediterranean J. of Social Sciences, 6, 2, pp. 471-478, (2015); Lawrence M.N., Butler M.B., Becoming aware of the challenges of helping students learn: An examination of the nature of learning during a service learning experience, Teacher Educ.

Thus, utility vehicles deployed by municipal operators have to fulfill these regulations. The project ELAAN, presented here, addresses this challenge by developing a fully electric propulsion system eliminating noise and exhaust emissions almost completely. The propulsion system uses a combination of hydrogen fed Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Fell (PEMFC) systems and lithium ion battery modules. These components follow a modular approach, which makes adoption of the modules for additional appli -cations, such as the material handling sector possible. Within the project ELAAN, fuel cell and battery modules are combined with an electric motor to power a utility vehicle LADOG T1250 which is often used in municipal applications. Conventionally, the vehicle is powered by a four cylinder diesel engine which feeds a hydraulic pump. As fuel cells, batteries and electric motor replace the diesel engine and hydraulic traction system, the fuel economy can be improved by a fac -tor of approximately three. Hydrogen is stored at 350 bar and can be refilled within few minutes. This makes the use of the electric vehicle comparable with the conventional one in terms of operation and refill time. Research and development activities within this project include analysis of the power and energy require -ments, development of the electric motor, fuel cell system and battery module, integration of the compo -nents into the vehicle as well as accompanying modelling of fuel cell and battery in order to improve the system layout and operating method. © 2017 MOBI -Mobility, Logistics and Automotive Technology Research Centre.","","Diesel electric traction; Diesel engines; Engine cylinders; Fuel economy; Hydrogen; Lithium-ion batteries; Materials handling; Polyelectrolytes; Propulsion; Traction motors; Electric propulsion systems; Eliminating noise; Fuel cell batteries; Hybrid propulsion systems; Material handling; Polymer electrolyte membranes; Propulsion system; Research and development; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC)","","","","","Devlin P., Kiuru K., DOE hydrogen and fuel cells program record 15003, Industry Deployed Fuel Cell Powered Lift Trucks, (2015); Geitmann S., Aufsatz „H2IntraDrive -Erprobung von BZ-Niederflurzeugen, Zeitschrift HZwei, (2016)","S.

This paper aims to underscore the significance, drivers and barriers to ensure “usage” of data sets conceding that re-use of data sets is one of the key objectives of any OGD initiative. Design/methodology/approach: With a documentary analysis approach, the OGD initiative of Sri Lanka is investigated for the present purpose. Furthermore, the theoretical model of citizen engagement in OGD suggested by Sieber and Johnson (2015) is being referred to appreciate the extent to which the usage of data sets is facilitated via the OGD platform. Findings: There are drivers as well as barriers as far as facilitating the usage of the data sets in the Sri Lankan OGD initiative is concerned. For instance, some of the drivers are the provision of suggesting data sets or the possibility of referring to data sets which are historical in nature. However, there are countless barriers to usage than the drivers. For instance, there is absence of metadata in the data sets; the data sets are not updated regularly; there are historical data; the formats of the data sets are limited in nature and are not user-friendly; there is no facility of conducting data visualization or analytics, and there is no collaborative approach towards building further the OGD initiative. Research limitations/implications: As only one case study is probed in the paper, further research is warranted to undertake a comparative approach by taking two or more case studies into consideration. Practical implications: This study holds relevance for Sri Lankan Government and other stakeholders (policy makers, citizens, developers and the like) so far as furthering of user engagement in OGD initiative is concerned. Social implications: Facilitating more usage by citizens would increase their engagement, and they might derive value out of the data sets. At the same time, the government’s objective of ensuring increased usage of the data sets would be better realized. Originality/value: “Transparency-by-design” approach had its focus on the publishing phase of OGD, and this paper seeks to provide its logical conclusion by emphasizing upon “usage by stakeholders” because by opening data sets, the government has the target to ensure that these open data sets are being used and re-used. Therefore, it is the outcome which is being discussed with the support of a case study set in the background of Sri Lanka’s Open Data initiative. Besides, this is the first study which probes the OGD initiatives of Sri Lanka – therein lies the major contribution of the study. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Citizen engagement; Engagement;

We followed 5070 adolescents aged 12-16 years across a three-year period in lower secondary education. The variance on school and student level was estimated and a three-level mixed-effects regression model was fit to analyze differences in citizenship development. The results indeed show development of citizenship competences during secondary school, but the observed patterns were not always positive. Students generally showed an increase in their citizenship knowledge, but a decline in their societal interest, prosocial ability and reflective thinking. Differences between groups of students could be explained by both schools and student characteristics. Especially girls and minority students developed the most citizenship competences. Understanding these differences is important for schools to improve their practices in ways that support the development of citizenship competences of various groups of students. © 2015 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.","Citizenship development;

Perhaps even more importantly, by conveying powerful messages about how the state views poor people, welfare programs shape people's views about themselves as subjects or citizens. Theoretical debates on how public policies can enhance democratic citizenship inspire our study of Brazil's Bolsa Família (Family Grant). Has this conditional cash transfer program, which forms a major point of contact between the state and millions of poor Brazilians, elevated feelings of social inclusion and agency? A prominent perspective in the welfare-state literature would not expect a positive outcome given the strict means testing and behavioral requirements entailed. Yet our focus group research with Bolsa Família recipients suggests that the program does foster a sense of belonging and efficacy. Policy design and government discourse matter. This innovative welfare program yields rich insights on alternative paths to citizenship development for middle- and low-income countries in the third wave of democracy.

The article clarifies what is meant by the ""political"" role of the firm and how this political role relates to its economic role. To this end, the authors present an ordonomic concept of corporate citizenship and illustrate the concept by way of comparison with the Aristotelian idea of individual citizenship for the antique polis. According to our concept, companies take a political role if they participate in rule-setting processes and rule-finding discourses. Though this political role of the corporation is in principle ambivalent, the authors conclude that in such processes of ""new governance"" the economic and political roles of the firm need not contradict each other but can follow the same win-win logic of individual self-perfection through cooperative social interactions. © The Author(s) 2013.","Aristotle; corporate citizenship; ordonomics; self-perfection; value creation","","","","","","Albareda L., Corporate responsibility, governance and accountability: From self-regulation to co-regulation, Corporate Governance, 8, pp. 430-439, (2008); Barley S.R., Corporations, democracy, and the public good, Journal of Management Inquiry, 16, pp. 201-215, (2007); Baumol W.J., Altruism, Morality, and Economic Theory, pp. 45-56, (1975); Baumol W.J., Entrepreneurship: Productive, unproductive, and destructive, Journal of Political Economy, 98, pp. 893-921, (1990); Baumol W.J., The Free-Market Innovation Machine: Analyzing the Growth Miracle of Capitalism, (2002); Baumol W.J., The Microtheory of Innovative Entrepreneurship, (2010); Becker G.S., Nobel lecture: The economic way of looking at behavior, Journal of Political Economy, 101, pp. 385-409, (1993); Beckmann M., Pies I., Corporate Citizenship, Contractarianism and Ethical Theory: Philosophical Considerations of Business Ethics, pp. 87-115, (2008); Bhagwati J.N., Directly unproductive, profit-seeking (DUP) activities, Journal of Political Economy, 90, pp. 988-1002, (1982); Boatright J.R., Does business ethics rest on a mistake?, Business Ethics Quarterly, 9, pp. 583-591, (1999); Bowles S., Microeconomics: Behavior, Institutions, and Evolution, pp. 23-55, (2004); Brennan G., Buchanan J.M., The Reason of Rules: Constitutional Political Economy, (2000); Buchanan J.M., Essays on the Political Economy, pp. 32-46, (1989); Buchanan J.M., The domain of constitutional economics, Constitutional Political Economy, 1, pp. 1-18, (1990); Buttkereit S., Pies I., Corporate Citizenship, Contractarianism and Ethical Theory: Philosophical Considerations of Business Ethics, pp. 135-147, (2008); Coleman J.S., Foundations of Social Theory, (1990); Collins S.D., Aristotle and the Rediscovery of Citizenship, (2006); Crane A., Matten D., Incorporating the corporation in citizenship: A response to Norman and Néron, Business Ethics Quarterly, 18, pp. 27-33, (2008); Crane A., Matten D., Moon J., Corporations and Citizenship, (2008); Detomasi D.A., The multinational corporation and global governance.

This access is often achieved through the use of several shared web proxy gateways. These network infrastructures consist of heterogeneous technologies and combine diverse routing protocols. Network-aware state-of-art proxy selection schemes for WMNs do not work in this heterogeneous environment. We developed a client-side gateway selection mechanism that optimizes the client-gateway selection, agnostic to underlying infrastructure and protocols, requiring no modification of proxies nor the underlying network. The choice is sensitive to network congestion and proxy load, without requiring a minimum number of participating nodes. Extended Vivaldi network coordinates are used to estimate client-proxy network performance. The load of each proxy is estimated passively by collecting the Time-to-First-Byte of HTTP requests, and shared across clients. Our proposal was evaluated experimentally with clients and proxies deployed in guifi.net, the largest community wireless network in the world. Our selection mechanism avoids proxies with heavy load and slow internal network paths, with overhead linear to the number of clients and proxies. © 2017 IFIP.","","Arts computing; HTTP; Internet protocols; Mesh generation; MESH networking; Network routing; Wireless mesh networks (WMN); Heterogeneous environments; Heterogeneous technology; Heterogeneous wireless mesh networks; Network congestions; Network coordinates; Network infrastructure; Selection mechanism; Underlying networks; Gateways (computer networks)","","","","","Global Internet Report 2015, (2015); Wg G., Global Access to the Internet for All Research Group, (2016); Vega D., Baig R., Cerda-Alabern L., Medina E., Meseguer R., Navarro L., A technological overview of the guifi.net community network, Computer Networks, 93, pp. 260-278, (2015); Rey-Moreno C., Roro Z., Tucker W.D., Siya M.J., Bidwell N.J., Simo-Reigadas J., Experiences, challenges and lessons from rolling out a rural wifi mesh network, ACM Computing for Development (ACMDEV).

This theme is further developed here, in two directions. Normatively, I argue that the Roman tradition of legal citizenship provides a better foil for understanding current citizenship developments than Greek political citizenship, which is predominant in political theory. Empirically, three cases of instrumentalism are highlighted: the selling of citizenship, expanding provisions of external citizenship, and the rapidly evolving European Union citizenship as a citizenship without identity. While states have always been strategists in matters of citizenship, particularly in inter-state relations, the novelty is to see individuals also in this role, seizing possibilities that states have often inadvertently created for them. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Citizenship; Europe; immigration; individualism; liberalism; nationalism","citizenship; immigration; individualism; liberalism; nationalism; political theory","","","","","Altan-Olcay O., Balta E., Class and Passports: Transnational Strategies of Distinction in Turkey, Sociology, pp. 1-17, (2015); Balot R., Revisiting the Classical Ideal of Citizenship, Oxford Handbook of Citizenship, (2017); Baubock R., Stakeholder Citizenship and Transnational Political Participation, Fordham Law Review, 75, pp. 2393-2447, (2007); Baubock R., The Rights and Duties of External Citizenship, Citizenship Studies, 13, 5, pp. 475-499, (2009); Baubock R., What is Wrong with Selling Citizenship?

E-government facilitates the provision of relevant government information in electronic form to the citizens promptly; better services for the citizen; the citizen development through information access without bureaucracy; the increasing productivity and cost saving in doing business with supplier and customer from government; and participation of public policy in decision-making. E-governance refers to how a manager and supervisor utilize IT and Internet to execute their function in supervision, planning, organization, coordination, and employee effectively. Principle of IT Governance in the digital era must not be separated from the good information technology governance. Information technology has been entered in business strategy of government, so the decision-making and the supervision have become an important agenda that discussed in the meeting of high officials in the government. Nowadays, there are many cases of digital asset misuse, one way to prevent it is to implement IT good Governance in government. © 2016 IEEE.","Digital Era; E-Government; IT Governance","Decision making; Digital devices; Information management; Business strategy; Digital era; E-governments; Government information; Government institutions; Information access; Information technology governance; IT governance; Government data processing","","","","","Ahmad B.S., Studi Kesiapan Pemanfaatan Teknologi Informasi dan Komunikasi serta Implementasi e-government dengan Kerangka Kerja Cobit, Jurnal Buletin Pos Dan Telekomunikasi, 9, 1, (2011); ITGI Governance Report, (2006); Sharma S.K., An E-government services framework, encyclopedia of commerce, e-government and mobile commerce, Mehdi Khosrow-Pour, Information ResourcesManagement Association, Idea Group Reference, USA, pp. 373-378, (2006); Tata kelola dan organisasi teknologi informasi dan komunikasi, Peraturan Gubernur Pemerintah Provinsi Daerah Khusus Ibukota, (2008); Jakli J., Stemberger M.I., Towards t-Government by increasing process maturity in public sector, Handbook of Research on ICT-Enabled Transformational Government: A Global Perspective, IGI Global, pp. 15-34, (2009); O'Brien J., Marakas G.M., Management Information Systems, (2010); Sohal A.S., Fitzpatrick P., IT governance and management in large Australian organizations, International Journal of Production Economics, 75, 1-2, pp. 97-112, (2002); Henderson J.C., Venkataraman N., Strategic alignment: Leavragining information technology for transforming organization, IBM Systems Journal, 32, 1, pp. 4-16, (1993); Weill P., Ross J.W., IT Governance-how Top Performers Manage It Decision Rights for Superior Results, (2004); Van Grembergen W., De Haes S., Enterprise Governance of Information Technology: Achieving Strategic Alignment and Value, (2009); Brown A.E., Grant G.G., Framing the framework: A review of it governance research, Communications of the Association for Information Systems, 15, pp. 696-712, (2005); Grant G., Chau D., Developing a generic framework for egovernment, Journal of Global Information Management, 13, 1, pp. 1-30, (2005); Patrick D., Helen M., The second wave of digital era governance, American Political Science Association Conference, (2011); Perko J., IT goveranace and enterprise architecture as prerequisites for assimilation of service oriented architecture.

The application of a passion-based approach to student learning, and the encouragement of ‘scholarly citizenship’ in students, helps to develop graduates who are already engaged with, passionate about and committed to the profession they are about to enter. However, new professionals need to be further enculturated into the profession and practice of LIS and nurtured in order for their passion to be sustained and good professional and organisational ‘citizenship’ developed. Passion and engagement are closely connected with good citizenship in the academy, workplace and profession where citizenship is a willingness to contribute beyond the usual requirements of participation, employment or membership. This article first describes why people enter the information professions and then presents a variety of strategies for academic programs and the information profession to develop the values of passion, engagement and citizenship in new professionals. © 2016 Australian Library & Information Association.","communities of practice; LIS education; organisational citizenship; Passion-based learning; professional citizenship","","","","","","ALIA New Graduates, (2013); Bertot J.C., Jaeger P.T., Sarin L., Forbes folly: Demonstrating the real net worth of a library degree, American Libraries, 43, pp. 30-33, (2012); Bosch E.K., Ramachandran H., Luevano S., Wakiji E., The resource team model: An innovative mentoring program for academic librarians, New Review of Academic Librarianship, 16, pp. 57-74, (2010); Brown J.S., New learning environments for the 21st Century, (2005); Brown J.S., Adler R.P., Minds on fire: Open education, the long tail and learning 2.0, Educause Review, 43, pp. 16-32, (2008); Chao G.T., O'Leary-Kelly A.M., Wolf S., Klein H.J., Gardner P.D., Organizational socialization: Its content and consequences, Journal of Applied Psychology, 79, pp. 730-743, (1994); The Macquarie dictionary, (2013); Cook S.D.N., Brown J.S., Bridging epistemologies: The generative dance between organizational knowledge and organizational knowing, Organization Science, 10, pp. 381-400, (1999); Being passionate about your work – more important than cash, WorkplaceInfo: News & Info for Australian HR/IR Professionals, (2012); Dewey J., The school and society, (1915); Farh J., Earley P.C., Lin S.-C., Impetus for action: A cultural analysis of justice and organizational citizenship behavior in Chinese society, Administrative Science Quarterly, 42, pp. 421-444, (1997); Havergal C., Is ‘academic citizenship’ under strain?, Times Higher Education, (2015); Janes J., The toxic middle: Here’s to the new blood surging into the profession, American Libraries Magazine, (2013); Ladenson S., Mayers D., Hyslop C., SPEC Kit 323: Socializing new hires, (2011); Lave J., Wenger E., Situated learning: Legitimate peripheral participation, (1991); Levine T.H., Socializing future social studies teachers and K-12 students: Whether, when, and why, Social Studies, 101, pp. 69-74, (2010); Lockwood N.R., Organizational entry: Onboarding, orientation and socialization, (2006); Macfarlane B., Defining and rewarding academic citizenship: The implications for university promotions policy, Journal of Higher Education Policy and Management, 29, pp. 261-273, (2007); Macfarlane B., The academic citizen: The virtue of service in university life, (2007); Mackay H., The art of belonging, (2014); Maiers A., Sandvold A., The classroom: A framework for teaching and learning, (2011); Podsakoff P.M., MacKenzie S.B., Paine J.B., Bachrach D.G., Organizational citizenship behaviors: A critical review of the theoretical and empirical literature and suggestions for future research, Journal of Management, 26, pp. 513-563, (2000); Power M., Do scholars need ‘performance free’ time and space?, Times Higher Education, (2014); Reynolds S., Welch B., Carroll M., Passionate practitioners: Engaging not just the head but also the heart, Education for Information, 29, pp. 243-251, (2012); Smith J., The best and worst master’s degrees for jobs, Forbes.com, (2012); Sullivan M., ALA president responds to Forbes.com post that library and information science is among the worst master’s degrees, American Libraries, (2012); Sunal C.S., Haas M.E., Social studies for the elementary and middle grades.

EPA, citizen-developers are fighting back against doubtful Clean Water Act enforcement actions. In 2005, Michael and Chantell Sackett purchased a 0.63-acre lot within an existing residential subdivision in Priest Lake, Idaho. After having obtained all the necessary local building permits, the Sacketts' employees commenced work on the construction of a three-bedroom family home on the site. A few days into construction, with only a layer of gravel having been put down, agents from EPA and the Corps came onto the property and verbally ordered the employees to stop work. The agents stated that the lot contained wetlands protected under the CWA. The Sacketts' compliance order charged them with having violated the act by discharging rock and gravel into regulated wetlands without a permit. After several court cases, the Supreme Court rejected EPA's argument that the CWA precludes judicial review under the APA. The justices noted that the APA creates a presumption in favor of judicial review. The courts nonetheless found that the challenged agency actions had profound practical impacts that, without the safeguard of immediate judicial review, would leave the regulated entity with an untenable choice: comply at great cost and with no appeal process, or refuse to comply and incur potentially immense penalties.","","compliance; construction; environmental protection; law enforcement; regulatory framework; water management; wetland","","","","","","","","Environmental Law Institute","","","","","","07315732","","ENVFE","","English","Environ.

It compares two different sport contexts: institutionalized and competitive sport and self-regulated street sports. It aims to articulate, analyze, and discuss the collected data based on two complementary studies, respectively dealing with legal consciousness (Long, Pantaléon, Faccenda, and Bruant, 2009) and responsibility (Long, Pantaléon, and Bruant, 2008). The results stand in contrast to current beliefs about these two kinds of practice. The conceptions of citizenship that adolescents highlight are related to the contextual characteristics of their sport socialization.

Provided that an education system is able to positively change the individuals’ perspectives on life, it may allow individuals to acquire terminal behaviors easier. This is due to the fact that an individual’s perspective on life is a significant factor that has an effect on his or her habits and behaviors. Determination of the main characteristics of this perspective on life, referred as lifestyles will definitely make a significant contribution to the understanding of which factors play a role in the behaviors and habits of the individuals. Purpose of the Study: The objective of this paper is to determine whether there is a correlation between the lifestyles adopted by individuals in their social lives and the self-regulated learning skills they use during the learning process. Method: In this paper, correlation research design was used and the data was gathered from a total of 726 student teachers between the ages of 20 and 35, who were still in their final year studying in various departments in the faculty of education or those who receive pedagogical formation (teacher certificate program). Lifestyle Inventory was used to determine the lifestyles of the student teachers and Self-Regulated Learning Strategies Scale was used to determine the self-regulated skills of the students in the study. Correlation analysis was carried out to determine whether there was a correlation between the lifestyles of the student teachers and their self-regulated learning strategies and regression analysis was performed to determine which types of lifestyles were the predictors of self-regulated learning strategies. Findings: The results of the study indicated that there was a positive correlation between self-regulated learning strategies and perfection, appreciation, expectation, control, and self-respect-oriented lifestyles of the students. Perfection-oriented lifestyle had the highest level of positive correlation whereas control-oriented lifestyle had the lowest level of positive correlation with self-regulated learning strategies. The results of the multiple linear regression analysis carried out to determine which lifestyles as a dependent variable had significant contribution to self-regulated learning strategies showed that the variables that made topmost contribution to the model were perfection, appreciation, and expectation-oriented lifestyles, respectively. Conclusion and Recommendations: The results of the study indicate that lifestyles are associated with the learning strategies of the individuals. A review of literature shows that families and teachers have a significant role in shaping the lifestyles adopted by students. Consequently, it is considered important that parents and teachers should be knowledgeable about the factors influential in shaping the lifestyles of the students, and they should be informed about their responsibilities in this respect. The role of lifestyles should be emphasized to parents with regards to the process of raising children, and it should also be included in curriculum for teacher education. If expectation lifestyles students are educated at the school, they might use their self regulated learning strategies more effectively. In this case, teaching and learning process which includes many activities might be designed to improve student academic achievement expectations. This study investigated the relationship between lifestyles and self regulated learning strategies. On the other hand, the investigation for the effects of the variables likes lifestyles and motivation, well being, and self conception self regulated learning strategies will contribute its nature. © 2016, Ani Publishing.

In this study corporate citizenship is studied in four dimensions like legal corporate, economical corporate, ethical corporate and voluntary corporate. And Effective factors' impact on corporate citizenship is explored based on thrifold dimensional model (Trifurcation theory of decesed Dr. Mizayi Ahranjany): behavioral, structural and content factors,as well. Methodology: In this study, 50 corporates of Food industry and of petrochemical industry, along with 200 selected individuals from directors' board on Tehran provinc's scale with stratified random sampling method, are choosed as acturial sample. If based on functional goal and compilation methods, The present study is a description of correlation type; questionnaier is used for accumulation of initial Data. For Instrument Validity expert's opinion is used. and structural equations and its reliability is qualified by using Cronbach Alpha Results: The results of this study indicates that close to 70 pecent of under survey corporates have not a good condition in corporate citizenship and all of structural factors, behavioral factors,contextual factors, have a great deal of impression and imapct on the advent corporate citizenship behavior in the producing Units.among the behavioral factors, social responsibility; among structural factors, organic structure and human centered orientation, medium size, high organiztional capacity; and among the contextual factors, the clientele's positive viewpoints toward corporates had the utmost importance in impression on under survey Producing units. Conclusions: Results of this study proved that under survey producing corporates, are not in a desirable condition of corporate citizenship behavior so that, according to the opinions of Directors' board, in the past years the average of citizenship factors have been lesser than usually from a legal,economical, ethical and voluntarily perspective. by considering the current crises of the nation that are mostly caused by economical sanctions, Producing Units haven't been able to reach their commercial and economical goals. On this account,. naturally the present situation of market has made them to overlook what formerly had been their ethical principle. According to what was mentioned, corporates must make some fundamental changes in their strategy, goals and organizational structures in order to gain access to corperate citizenship behavior and to gain other advantages of these behaviors. They must develope their social responsibility, social accountability and corporate governance among its employees as the most important strategies of corporate that could be their citizenship On the other hand corporates must be in think of improving their social capital through setting up powerful communical nets and through exercising their commitments toward society's individuals. in short, corporates' directors must have faith in commitment to society's ethical principles and ruling canon, anf for short terms benefits do not act as a way that clientele loss their trust in them so that they behave those corporates with an inappropriate citizenship behavior, and even it may cause Society not to admit those corporates as its Citizens.","Behavioral factors; Contextual factors; Corporate Citizenship; Producing units; Structural factors","","","","","","Anderson R., Williams, Toward Global Corporate Citizenship Reframing Foreign Direct Investment Law Williams., pp. 10-21, (2009); Anderson R., Williams, Toward global corporate citizenship reframing foreign direct investment law williams, Journal of International Law, pp. 10-21, (2009); Arora P., Dharwadkar R., Corporate governance and corporate social Responsibility CCSR: The moderating Roles of Attainment Discrepancy and organization slack and Corporate Governance, Journal An Internsational Review, pp. 1-17, (2011); Aupperle K., Et al., An empirical examination of the relationship between corporate responsibility and profitability, The Academy of Management Journal, 28, 2, pp. 446-463, (1985); Ahmad R., Governance, Social Accountability and the civil society, JOAAG, 3, 50, pp. 10-21, (2008); Arbeitsbereich C.B., Corporate Social Responsibility of SMS in China: Challenges and Out Looks, (2010); Blazovich J., Murphy S L., Ethical Corporate Citizenship: Does It Pay, pp. 1-42, (2012); Bryan T., Exploring the Dimensions of Organizational Capacity for Local Social Service Delivery Organizations Using A Multi-method Approach, pp. 1-180, (2011); Baker R., Accountability Corporate Governance and the Role of the State Responseible, pp. 1-35, (2004); Bostsswana K., The Confluence of Corporation Governance and Business Ethics in Kenya.

The success of community policing depends on active citizen participation. Previous research shows Online Social Networks (OSN) such as Facebook encourage active citizen participation during law and order situations. However, little is known about role of OSN in developing community relations between police and citizens. Developing countries such as India have limited police personnel which increases the need of community policing. This project explores perceptions of senior police officers on the role of OSN and develops a set of requirements for an OSN based system that can enhance citizens' interaction with police. From the interview of twenty officers of Indian Police Services (IPS), we show four broad aspects in which OSN helps community policing: (1) strengthen social ties, (2) enforce social norms, (3) enable citizen reporting, and (4) keep citizens informed.","","Climate change; Developing countries; Economic and social effects; Public relations; Social networking (online); Citizen participation; Community policing; Developing communities; Online social networks (OSN); Police officers; Social media; Social norm; Social ties; Law enforcement","","","","","Charmaz K., Constructing Grounded Theory: A Practical Guide Through Qualitative Analysis; Denef S., Bayerl P.S., Kaptein N., Social media and the police-Tweeting practices of british police Forces during the August 2011 Riots, Proc.

In this article we explore the value of various types of democratic engagement for strengthening the democratic character of local and international communities throughout Europe. To this end, we present our democratic engagement typology and its derivation from empirical and conceptual research, and discuss several strengths and limitations of each type of engagement. We also explain the additive value of our typology in relation to existing engagement typologies, and conclude that in order to vitalize democratic communities, local and (inter)national communities and institutions also need to cultivate a thick type of democratic engagement among European youth. © 2015, Bielefeld University.

Although defining the term “a smart city” is worth taking a risk, the maturity of the smart city definition in terms of practical use and research has not been reached. Even if it is defined, it would highly depend on the context and unique nature of cities. Yet there are city components that are only found in smart cities. A study of these components would be the most practical way of understanding “what make a smart city”. Therefore, this study aims to analyse literature, review definitional elements of smart cities, and derive a comprehensive list of smart city components. Not being a one size fits all, smart city definitions are often interchangeable with other well-defined city conceptions. Those conceptions are a source to outline what smart cities are. Therefore, the terms digital city, intelligent city, ubiquitous city, global city, and sustainable city are compared with smart city characteristics. In the same way, definitional elements from ten latest literature sources were identified. Smart city components identified in the literature were then reviewed and combined to form a list of components under the themes; smart economy, smart people, smart living, smart environment, smart mobility, and smart governance which were supposed to integrate with Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure. While these components are the frontline, smart cities also intent to ensure urban, public services, and citizen development. With this, the paper presents a holistic summary of the characteristics that define the smartness of a smart city. © 2019, Ceylon Institute of Builders.

These tools significantly lower the level of technical skill that is required for app development, which makes them particularly appealing to citizen developers, i.e., developers with little or no software engineering background. However, as the pervasiveness of these tools increases, so does their overall influence on the mobile ecosystem's security, as security lapses by such generators affect thousands of generated apps. The security of such generated apps, as well as their impact on the security of the overall app ecosystem, has not yet been investigated. We present the first comprehensive classification of commonly used OAGs for Android and show how to fingerprint uniquely generated apps to link them back to their generator. We thereby quantify the market penetration of these OAGs based on a corpus of 2,291,898 free Android apps from Google Play and discover that at least 11.1% of these apps were created using OAGs. Using a combination of dynamic, static, and manual analysis, we find that the services' app generation model is based on boilerplate code that is prone to reconfiguration attacks in 7/13 analyzed OAGs. Moreover, we show that this boilerplate code includes well-known security issues such as code injection vulnerabilities and insecure WebViews. Given the tight coupling of generated apps with their services' backends, we further identify security issues in their infrastructure. Due to the blackbox development approach, citizen developers are unaware of these hidden problems that ultimately put the end-users sensitive data and privacy at risk and violate the user's trust assumption. A particular worrisome result of our study is that OAGs indeed have a significant amplification factor for those vulnerabilities, notably harming the health of the overall mobile app ecosystem. © 2018 IEEE.","Android; app analysis; App Generator; Citizen Developer","Android (operating system); Application programs; Codes (symbols); Ecosystems; Risk perception; Amplification factors; Android; Citizen Developer; Development approach; Market penetration; On-line applications; Technical skills; Trust assumptions; Mobile security","","","","","CVE-2016-2107: Padding-oracle Attack Against AES CBC, (2016); Acar Y., Backes M., Bugiel S., Fahl S., McDaniel P., Smith M., Sok: Lessons learned from android security research for appified software platforms, Proc. 37th IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP '16), (2016); Adrian D., Bhargavan K., Durumeric Z., Gaudry P., Green M., Halderman J.A., Heninger N., Springall D., Thome E., Valenta L., Vander-Sloot B., Wustrow E., Zanella-Beguelin S., Zimmermann P., Imperfect forward secrecy: How Diffie-Hellman fails in practice, Proc. 22nd ACM Conference on Computer and Communication Security (CCS'15), (2015); Au K.W.Y., Zhou Y.F., Huang Z., Lie D., Pscout: Analyzing the android permission specification, Proc. 19th ACM Conference on Computer and Communication Security (CCS'12), (2012); Aviram N., Schinzel S., Somorovsky J., Heninger N., Dankel M., Steube J., Valenta L., Adrian D., Halderman J.A., Dukhovni V., Kasper E., Cohney S., Engels S., Paar C., Shavitt Y., DROWN: Breaking TLS Using SSLv2, (2016); Backes M., Bugiel S., Derr E., Reliable third-party library detection in android and its security applications, Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS '16), (2016); Backes M., Bugiel S., Derr E., Gerling S., Hammer C., R-droid: Leveraging android app analysis with static slice optimization, Proceedings of the 11th ACM on Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security (Asia CCS '16), (2016); Backes M., Bugiel S., Derr E., McDaniel P., Octeau D., Weisgerber S., On demystifying the android application framework: Re-visiting android permission specification analysis, Proc. 25th USENIX Security Symposium (SEC'16), (2016); Backes M., Bugiel S., Gerling S., Scippa: System-centric ipc provenance on android, Proc. 30th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC'14), (2014); Beurdouche B., Bhargavan K., Delignat-Lavaud A., Fournet C., Kohlweiss M., Pironti A., Strub P.Y., Zinzindohoue J.K., A messy state of the union: Taming the composite state machines of tls, Proc. 36th IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP'15), (2015); Book T., Pridgen A., Wallach D.S., Longitudinal analysis of android ad library permissions, MoST'13, (2013); Chin E., Felt A.P., Greenwood K., Wagner D., Analyzing interapplication communication in android, Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services, pp. 239-252, (2011); Chin E., Wagner D., Bifocals: Analyzing webview vulnerabilities in android applications, Proc.

However, it should contain an emotional element for individuals to willingly identify themselves with the nation-state. The absence of such emotion often prompts bloody conflicts where people attempt to carve independent entities of power by fragmenting the nation-state. Youth, with their inherent zest for grand ventures, are often keen participants and even initiators of such conflicts. Citizenship therefore should entail an active process of emotional engagement especially of youth in order that sustainable solidarity may be fostered. Sri Lanka stands as an ideal case study in this regard, demonstrating the terrible consequences of the isolation of youth - whether real or perceived - from the collective identity of the state and the equally powerful impact they can have when properly integrated into the state mechanism. This paper discusses Tamil youth disillusionment in Sri Lanka that manifested itself in a vicious ethnic conflict in juxtaposition with the role of Sri Lankan youth as agents of peaceful change in a post-war nation-building context. In drawing a conclusion, the paper discusses the importance of active civic engagement of youth in building One Nation One People. © 2015 The Author(s).

Of particular importance to the activities of non-profit organizations cannot be overemphasized, because they are its activity replaces the passivity of the state and municipal structures that would have to carry out social programs. Social movement appears where the state has no resources to solve the real societal challenges and problems and the business is just not profitable. Like any organization, NGO needs funds to implement its activities. Often the main source of funds is grants, donations, but to count on this help continuously. The law allows NCOs to conduct entrepreneurial activities on the condition of expenditure of profits for statutory purposes. However, marketing, nonprofits are often not ready to compete with commercial organizations. This explains the relevance of the chosen topic in the modern economic realities. The subject of research is a commercial organization - the legal entity pursuing as the main goal of its activities deriving of profit. Such organizations may be created in the form of economic societies and partnerships, production cooperatives, state and municipal unitary enterprises. The result is that non-profit organizations this organization, created for the implementation of socially useful activities, through their institutions, natural persons or legal entities (both commercial and non-commercial), to achieve cultural, social, educational, scientific, charitable, managerial purposes, in order to implement fire and other safety of citizens, development of physical culture and sports, meet spiritual and other nonmaterial needs of citizens, legal aid, settlement of disputes and conflicts, protection of rights and legitimate interests of citizens and organizations. The purpose of the establishment may differ from the above stated; the main requirement is the focus of the organization on the achievement of public goods. The establishment of non-profit organizations seems to be very promising, given the possibility of almost unlimited use of the profit received from such activities to the statutory purpose, to the same conditions of taxation of nonprofit organizations, even engaged in economic activity, is much more favorable than the order of payment of taxes prescribed for all types of commercial legal entities.","Distribution of profits; Economics environment; Entrepreneurial activity; Establishment of the organization; Legal entity; Non-profit organization","","","","","","Barzanti L., Giove S., Pezzi A., A decision support system for non-profit organizations, Fuzzy Logic and Soft Computing Applications: 11th International Workshop, pp. 270-280, (2017); Bianco A., Larosa E., Pileggi C., Nobile C.G.A., Pavia M., Utilization of health-care services among immigrants recruited through non-profit organizations in southern Italy, International Journal of Public Health, 61, 6, pp. 673-682, (2016); Bonomi S., Ricciardi F., Rossignoli C., Service ecosystems for the common good: A case of non-profit network organization, Exploring Services Science: 8th International Conference, pp. 397-408, (2017); Chen J., Liang L., Yao D.Q., Pre-positioning of relief inventories for non-profit organizations: a newsvendor approach, Annals of Operations Research, (2017); Cornforth C., David Fishel: The Book of the Board: Effective Governance for Non-profit Organizations (3rd edition), VOLUNTAS: International Journal of Voluntary and Nonprofit Organizations, 27, 6, pp. 2962-2963, (2016); D'Anselmi P., Chymis A., Di Bitetto M., Non-Profit organizations not subject to competition unknown values and stakeholders, The Pro-Business Outcome and the Role of Competition, pp. 53-63, (2017); Domingues I., Machado J.C., Lean thinking in non-profit organizations, Green and Lean Management, pp. 71-107, (2017); On non-profit organizations., Collection of legislation of the Russian federation, 3, (1996); Gottlichova M., Changes in the legal system of the non-governmental organizations in the Czech Republic and the possibilities for innovation of communication policy in the non-profit sector, Strategic Innovative Marketing: 4th IC-SIM, pp. 323-329, (2017); Henttonen K., Lahikainen K., Jauhiainen T., Governance mechanisms in multi-party non-profit collaboration, Public Organization Review, 16, 1, pp. 1-16, (2016); Holmberg K., Hellsten I., Organizational communication on twitter: Differences between non-profit and for-profit organizations in the context of climate change, Cross-media-Kommunikation in kulturbedingten Handlungsräumen: Mediengerechte Anwendung und zielgruppenspezifische Ausrichtung, pp. 305-313, (2016); Kapitonov I.A., Voloshin V.I., Zhukovskaya I.V., Shulus A.A., Small and medium-sized enterprises as a driver of innovative development of the Russian fuel and energy complex, International Journal of Energy Economics and Policy, 7, 3, pp. 231-239, (2017); Karakaya E., Karakaya G., Developing a risk management framework and risk assessment for non-profit organizations: A case study, Risk Management, Strategic Thinking and Leadership in the Financial Services Industry: A Proactive Approach to Strategic Thinking, pp. 297-308, (2017); Knutsen W., The non-profit sector is dead, long live the non-profit sector!, VOLUNTAS: International Journal of Voluntary and Nonprofit Organizations, 27, 4, pp. 1562-1584, (2016); Meek R., Gojkovic D., Mills A., The involvement of non-profit organizations in prisoner reentry in the uk: prisoner awareness and engagement, The Voluntary Sector in Prisons: Encouraging Personal and Institutional Change, pp. 173-194, (2016); Polyanin A.V., Surovneva A.A., Management of non-profit organizations in a crisis, Central Russian Herald of Social Sciences, 12, 2, pp. 143-150, (2017); Potluka O., Spacek M., von Schnurbein G., Impact of the EU structural funds on financial capacities of non-profit organizations, VOLUNTAS: International Journal of Voluntary and Nonprofit Organizations, (2017); Collection of legislation of the Russian federation, 32, (1994); Vontea A.A., Stancu A., For-Profits and non-profits: A research on the collaboration's premises during the financial crisis, Corporate Social Responsibility in the Post-Financial Crisis Era, pp. 243-262, (2017); Wechtler H., Koveshnikov A., Dejoux C., Career anchors and cross-cultural adjustment among expatriates in a non-profit organization, Management International Review, 57, 2, pp. 277-305, (2017); Zhu H., Wang P., Bart C., Board processes, board strategic involvement and organizational performance in for-profit and non-profit organizations, Journal of Business Ethics, 136, 2, pp. 311-328, (2016)","","","Allied Business Academies","","","","","","15440036","","","","English","J.

This paper examines citizen responses to the shift from post-war socialist urbanization that sought to eradicate inequality to post-reform city planning that advocates private property. It asks: how do urban residents at risk of relocation articulate their rights to the post-socialist city? Tracing the use and circulation of bureaucratic artefacts between citizens, developers and the state, it shows how government documents, far from being mere tools of state regulation, are productive of active, participatory subjectivities and a growing sense of moral-political agency. This agency manifests itself in the collective act of petitioning through which residents contest urban redevelopment and the withdrawal of the state by employing the language of tình cam (sentiment) as an affective tool and logic of bureaucratic rationality.","Affect; Bureaucracy; Materiality; Socialism; Urbanization; Vietnam","Viet Nam; bureaucracy; post-war; property rights; redevelopment; relocation; socialism; urban renewal; urban society; urbanization","","","","","Bennett J., Vibrant Matter: A Political Ecology of Things, (2010); Digregorio M., Into the land rush: Facing the urban transition in Hanoi's western suburbs, International Development Planning Review, 33, 3, pp. 293-319, (2011); Son D., Nəm 2020 Se Không Còn Nhà Tam, (2011); Drummond L., Street scenes: Practices of public and private space in urban Vietnam, Urban Studies, 37, 12, pp. 2377-2391, (2000); Endres K.W., Making law: Small-scale trade and corrupt exceptions at the Vietnam-China border, American Anthropologist, 116, 3, pp. 611-625, (2014); Feldman I., Governing Gaza: Bureaucracy, Authority, and the Work of Rule, 1917-1967, (2008); Gupta A., Red Tape: Bureaucracy, Structural Violence, and Poverty in India, (2012); Yen H., Thành phô Hà Nôi: Lo vôn dê cai tao, xây dung chung cu c͡, Mua Bán Nhà Dât, (2006); Harms E., Vietnam's civilizing process and the retreat from the street: A turtle's eye view from Ho Chi Minh City, City and Society, 21, 2, pp. 182-206, (2009); Harms E., Beauty as control in the new Saigon: Eviction, new urban zones, and atomized dissent in a Southeast Asian city, American Ethnologist, 39, 4, pp. 735-750, (2012); Harvey D., Rebel Cities: From the Right to the City to the Urban Revolution, (2012); Hull M.S., Government of Paper: The Materiality of Bureaucracy in Urban Pakistan, (2012); Kim A.M., Learning to Be Capitalists: Entrepreneurs in Vietnam's Transition Economy, (2008); Kim A.M., Talking back: The role of narratives in Vietnam's recent land compensation changes, Urban Studies, 48, 3, pp. 493-508, (2011); Koh D.W.H., Wards of Hanoi, (2006); Laszczkowski M., Building the future: Construction, temporality, and politics in Astana, Focaal-Journal of Global and Historical Anthropology, 60, pp. 77-92, (2011); Latour B., Reassembling the Social: An Introduction to Actor-Network Theory, (2005); Leshkowich A.M., Standardized forms of Vietnamese selfhood: An ethnographic genealogy of documentation, American Ethnologist, 41, 1, pp. 143-162, (2014); Malarney S.K., Culture, virtue, and political transformation in contemporary northern Viet Nam, Journal of Asian Studies, 56, 4, pp. 899-920, (1997); McFarlane C., The city as assemblage: Dwelling and urban space, Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 29, 4, pp. 649-671, (2011); Navaro-Yashin Y., Make-believe papers, legal forms and the counterfeit: Affective interactions between documents and people in Britain and Cyprus, Anthropological Theory, 7, 1, pp. 79-98, (2007); Reed A., Documents unfolding, Documents: Artifacts of Modern Knowledge, pp. 158-177, (2006); Riles A., Introduction: In response, Documents: Artifacts of Modern Knowledge, (2006); Schwenkel C., Post/socialist affect: Ruination and reconstruction of the nation in urban Vietnam, Cultural Anthropology, 28, 2, pp. 252-277, (2013); Schwenkel C., Traveling architecture: East German urban designs abroad, International Journal for History, Culture and Modernity, 2, 2, pp. 155-174, (2014); Stoler A.L., Affective states, A Companion to the Anthropology of Politics, pp. 4-20, (2004); Wells-Dang A., Political space in Vietnam: A view from the ""rice-roots, The Pacific Review, 23, 1, pp. 93-112, (2010); Yan Y., Private Life under Socialism: Love, Intimacy, and Family Change in A Chinese Village 1949-1999, (2003)","C.

Citizens are playing a more active role by either designing platforms themselves or participating on platforms created by public agencies. Unfortunately, our theoretical knowledge about the nature of these platforms is limited. In this paper, we take the first steps towards understanding technology-enabled participatory platforms. Through an exploratory analysis, following the spirit of a grounded theoretic methodology, we examined technology-enabled participatory platforms in the 25 most populated cities in the United States. We deduce four main archetypes—citizen centric and citizen data, citizen centric and government data, government centric and citizen data, and government centric and citizen-developed solutions of technology-enabled participatory platforms. We describe the intricacies of how collective intelligence is leveraged on these platforms. Implications for local government managers and urban planners are discussed. We hypothesize how the future of these platforms might evolve in the not so distant future. © 2014, © 2014 The Society of Urban Technology.","cities; civic engagement; crowdsourcing; participatory platforms; technology","United States; knowledge; local government; local participation; participatory approach; urban area; urban planning","","","","","Arnstein S., A Ladder of Citizen Participation, Journal of the American Institute of Planners, 35, pp. 216-224, (1969); Bertalanffy L.V., General System Theory: Foundations, Development, Applications, (1968); Bimber B., Measuring the Gender Gap on the Internet, Social Science Quarterly, 81, 3, pp. 868-876, (2000); Carpini D.M.X., Cook F., Jacobs L.R., Public Deliberation, Discursive Participation, and Citizen Engagement: A Review of the Empirical Literature, Annual Review of Political Science, 7, 1, pp. 315-344, (2004); Churchman C.W., The Design of Inquiring Systems, (1971); Corbett F.; Dahl R.A., A Democratic Dilemma: System Effectiveness versus Citizen Participation, Political Science Quarterly, 109, 1, pp. 23-34, (1994); Dalton R.J., Citizenship Norms and the Expansion of Political Participation, Political Studies, 56, 1, pp. 76-98, (2008); Desouza K.C.; Desouza K.C.; Desouza K.C.; Desouza K.C., Bhagwatwar A., Citizen Apps to Solve Complex Urban Problems, Journal of Urban Technology, 19, 3, pp. 107-136, (2012); DiMaggio P., Hargittai E., Celeste C., Shafer S., Digital Inequality: From Unequal Access to Differentiated Use.

Businesses are always supported by IT, which tries to provide the needed tools. The problem is that businesses are constantly changing, so business experts are always forced to request IT to change their business software applications. IT development is time consuming and there is always the risk that the application will never be used, because by the time the development finishes the business environment has changed. A question arises if the business experts can create their own applications, saving development costs and adapting the business faster. A solution is to use the latest technology provided by Intelligent Business Process Management Suites.

The rise of such an event affects not only the people but also the environment and causes big financial losses and very often deteriorates the companýs reputation. The article reflects the changes in the area of preventing major industrial accidents during last 5 years in dependence how they are perceived by the companies. The basic threshold was the year 2013 when the new directive SEVESO III was adopted in the EU and subsequently the member states had to adapt it in their legal environment. A research was carried among the SEVESO establishments in Slovakia and the results are published in this article. In spite of the alteration of the law it is possible to identify several changes which are to be done also in the next period. The article shows the results from the statistical research, the conclusions from meetings with the SEVESO establishments in Slovakia and consultations with the competent authority-the Ministry of Environment of the Slovak Republic. The results revealed a whole range of problems which were implemented in the law already in 2015. In spite of this fact some problems persist and it is necessary to solve them in the near future. Based on the meeting with experts from other EU countries and on the comparison of the results we can say that similar problems are found also in other member states. © 2018 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.","","Accidents; Disasters; Industrial hygiene; Losses; Occupational diseases; Chemical companies; Competent authorities; Financial loss; Major industrial accidents; Ministry of environments; Problem areas; Slovak Republic; Statistical research; Computer circuits","","","","","Hudakova M., Et al., Analysis of the risks of small and medium-sized enterprises in the Zilina region, Communications: Scientific Letters of the University of Žilina, 17, 1, pp. 34-39, (2015); SEVESO II Directive; Major Accident Hazard: The Seveso Directive-Technological Disaster Risk Reduction; Holla K., Et al., Results of survey among SEVESO establishments in the Slovak Republic, Journal of Chemical Health & Safety, 23, 2, pp. 9-17, (2016); Sykorova K., Et al., Lessons learned from environmental risk assessment within the framework of Seveso Directive in Czech Republic and Italy, In Journal of Loss Prevention in the Process Industries, (2017); Delvosalle Ch., Aramis project: A comprehensive methodology for the identification of reference accident scenarios in process industries, Journal of Hazardous Materials, 130, 3, pp. 200-219, (2006); Holla K., Complex Model for Risk Assessment, (2014); Holla K., Industrial Accidents Prevention, (2014); Ostrom L.T., Risk Assessment: Tools, Techniques, and Their Applications, (2012); Rausand M., Risk Assessment: Theory, Methods, and Applications, (2011)","K.

Very often, the objective of such interventions is the acquisition and development of qualities associated with ‘good citizenship’. However, critical scholars have noted how sport-based initiatives are frequently used as a form of social control, focusing on the development of personal responsibility. As such, these initiatives accentuate more passive forms of citizenship, as opposed to more active forms of citizenship towards which many educational policies and programmes are aimed. Nevertheless, there is a limited amount literature which explores the connection between sport-based interventions and citizenship development within marginalised or ‘at-risk’ youth populations. This paper presents findings from a small-scale, qualitative study of one such (football-based) intervention located in a number of inner-city boroughs of London, UK. Placing the accounts of programme participants and staff at the centre of the analysis, the paper: (i) uncovers the practicalities and nuances of football being utilised as a tool for social engagement, and (ii) explores broader notions of personal and behavioural development in relation to the acquisition of citizenship qualities. The paper concludes by suggesting that sporting activity may confer citizenship benefits for young people, but only when integrated into wider programmes of social support and community engagement. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","citizenship; football (soccer); marginalised youth; qualitative research; Sport","citizenship; doctor patient relation; England; football; human; juvenile; qualitative research; soccer; social change; social support","","","","","Youth service in England and Wales, (1959); Andrews D.L., Mason D.S., Silk M.L., Qualitative methods in sports studies, (2005); Bailey R., Evaluating the relationship between physical education, sport and social inclusion, Educational Review, 57, 1, pp. 71-90, (2005); Bloyce D., Smith A., Sport policy and development: An introduction, (2010); Bowtell J., Community development through sport, (2006); Bradbury S., Kay T., Stepping into community?

That, at least, is the claim made by critics of the systems approach to deliberative democracy, who argue that its proponents have lost sight of the educative function that respectful public reasoning plays for citizens. In this article I offer a response to this line of argument. There is no good philosophical reason to suppose that only unitary deliberation can perform an educative function for citizens. The kinds of informal and uncooperative public speech that occur in distributed deliberative processes can also develop participants' civic capacities and civic virtue - and not merely through their systemic effects. This is an insight that should encourage us to rethink the design and facilitation of deliberative forums and pay more attention to citizens' everyday deliberation. © 2019 International Association for Public Participation.

However, such challenges are wicked and difficult to tame. They require novel solutions that account for and integrate contradictory perspectives within the local innovation ecosystem of firms, governments, and citizens. This article presents a successful civic innovation crowdsourcing project case study, in which multinational firm Bombardier encouraged a global civic crowd to co-create visionary solutions to the challenge of future mobility in crowded cities around the world. Bombardier recruited a global crowd of 900 individuals and facilitated the citizen development of more than 215 solutions of unique firm value. We explore the process and outcome of this crowdsourcing project and derive actionable design principles for a three-phased civic innovation crowdsourcing process including: (1) crowd construction, (2) crowd knowledge acquisition, and (3) crowd knowledge assimilation. This process enables the crowd to integrate members’ diverse and contradictory knowledge proactively at both the team and individual levels. Additionally, the crowd is able to balance extension of existing local solutions and exploration of path-breaking technologies and solution concepts. © 2016 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University","Bombardier Inc.; Civic innovation; Crowdsource; Crowdsourcing innovation; Innovation facilitation; Wicked problems","","","","","","Almirall E., Lee M., Majchrzak A., Open innovation requires integrated competition-community ecosystems: Lessons learned from civic open innovation, Business Horizons, 57, 3, pp. 391-400, (2014); Bohler-Baedeker S., Kost C., Merforth M., Urban mobility plans: National approaches and local practice, (2014); (2014); Camillus J., Strategy as a wicked problem, Harvard Business Review, 86, 5, pp. 98-101, (2008); (2014); Conklin E.J., Dialogue mapping: Building shared understanding of wicked problems, (2005); Farley J., Wicked problems, BioScience, 57, 9, pp. 797-798, (2007); Best-in-class smart city integrator: Visionary innovation leadership award, (2014); Gwet K.L., Handbook of inter-rater reliability: The definitive guide to measuring the extent of agreement among raters, (2014); (2014); Innes J.E., Booher D.E., Planning with complexity: An introduction to collaborative rationality for public policy, (2010); Jeppesen L.B., Lakhani K.R., Marginality and problem-solving effectiveness in broadcast search, Organization Science, 21, 5, pp. 1016-1033, (2010); Johnson B., Gann D., Smart London plan, (2010); Kietzmann J.H., Crowdsourcing: A revised definition and an introduction to new research, Business Horizons, 60, 2, pp. 151-153, (2017); Kitchin R., The real-time city?

As recent researches give increasing discussions to the roles different actors play and the division of responsibility within institutional procedures of Shequ, few empirical studies have been carried out to explore the everyday governing process and the stories happening at the receiving end of governance. This research uses a Foucauldian governmentality framework to critically analyse the Shequ institutions’ governing technologies in their everyday practices, and how these technologies succeed or fail to shape citizens’ conduct. Empirical evidences from the case study portray a hybridising scenario, in which the Shequ institutions embrace both the Maoist and Confucian discourses to cultivate active and responsible citizens. Nevertheless, residents’ divergent reactions to the government mobilisation suggest a process in which citizens develop their own ways to internalise or refuse the government interventions which aim to regulate their conduct. This paper concludes by suggesting that giving its materials of stories about the implementers and receivers of government discourses, neighbourhood governance can make important contributions to governmentality research in regards to the topics around the state’s power exercise at the grassroots society and citizens’ struggle around subjectivity. © 2015, © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2015.","China; government technologies; governmentality; neighbourhood governance; subjectification","China; citizenship; governance approach; government relations; infrastructure planning; neighborhood; power relations; technological development; urban policy; urban society","","","","","Bray D., Building ‘community’: New strategies of governance in urban China, Economy and Society, 35, 4, pp. 530-549, (2006); Burchell G., Liberal government and techniques of the self, Foucault and Pilitical Reason: Liberalism, Neo-Liberalism and Ratuonality of Government, pp. 19-35, (1996); Clarke J., Subjects of doubt: In search of the unsettled and the unfinished.

Six universities across a variety of disciplines have participated in the project; which targets to identify effective pedagogies and assessment methods for holistic competencies, and to collect the evidence of students' holistic competencies development. The focus is placed on engineering students and their learning in the current ongoing study. The project objectives are implemented by integrating community outreach activities and capstone project experience to foster context-driven innovation in engineering students.

The stages of urbanization are re-examined by considering semi-urbanization. Nine types of urban development are presented according to the relations between semi-urbanization and urbanization, and China’s urbanization is divided into five stages, namely, high incoordination, incoordination, low coordination, coordination, and high coordination. Results show that China’s semi-urbanization rate varies significantly from one area to another; its order in 2010 from the highest to the lowest value was as follows: east, middle, west, and northeast. Urbanization and semi-urbanization rates in inland cities increase much faster than those in coastal cities. In addition, semi-urbanization displays a spatial pattern similar to that of urbanization across China, with the sole exception of the northeastern region. Through a spatial autocorrelation analysis, the spatial concentration of semi-urbanization is determined to be increasing. High-value concentration areas are expanding in the coastal east, whereas low-value concentration areas are growing in the northeast. Lastly, the evolution of China’s urbanization model suggests a weakening trend of coordination between urbanization and semi-urbanization over the studied decade. Semi-urbanization can be viewed as a special production of China’s hukou system, which restricts the permanent settlement of migrants in cities. As such, China’s semi-urbanization trend is expected to exhibit a reversed U-shaped pattern as urbanization and citizenization develop. © 2016, Institute of Geographic Science and Natural Resources Research (IGSNRR), Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","census; China; hukou; semi-urbanization; spatial evolution; urbanization","","","","","","Afridi F., Li S.X., Ren Y., Social identity and inequality: The impact of China’s hukou system, Journal of Public Economics, 123, pp. 17-29, (2015); Cao G.Z., Bian X., Liu T., Comprehensive evaluation of the urbanization level in Yangtze River Delta region: An index framework based on the population, economic structure and landuse, Geographical Research, 30, 12, pp. 2139-2149, (2011); Cao G.Z., Li M., Ma Y., Et al., Self-employment and intention of permanent urban settlement: Evidence from a survey of migrants in China’s four major urbanising areas, Urban Studies, 52, 4, pp. 639-664, (2015); Chan K.W., China’s urbanization 2020: A new blueprint and direction, Eurasian Geography & Economics, 55, 1, pp. 1-9, (2014); Chen B.B., Review on identification method and driving mechanism of peri-urban area, Progress in Geography, 31, 2, pp. 210-220, (2012); Chen M.X., Liu W.D., Lu D.D., Challenges and the way forward in China’s new-type urbanization, Land Use Policy, 55, pp. 334-339, (2016); Ding J.H., Liu Z.Y., Cheng D.M., Et al., Areal differentiation of inter-provincial migration in China and characteristics of the flow field, Acta Geographica Sinica, 60, 1, pp. 106-114, (2005); Duan C.R., Wang W.L., Wang T.Y., Fifty years of the household registration system, Population Research, 32, 1, pp. 43-50, (2008); Gan J., Guo F.Y., Chen C., Et al., The spatio-temporal evolution characteristics of urbanization spatial differentiation in Northeast China, Scientia Geographica Sinica, 35, 5, pp. 565-574, (2015); Gottmann J., Megalopolis or the urbanization of the northeastern seaboard, Urban Planning International, 33, 3, pp. 189-200, (2007); Gu C.L., Kesteloot C., Cook I.G., Theorising Chinese urbanisation: A multi-layered perspective, Urban Studies, 52, 14, pp. 2564-2580, (2015); Han F., Cai J.M., The evolution and reconstruction of peri-urban rural habitat in China, Geographical Research, 30, 7, pp. 1271-1284, (2011); Han J., Wang Z.H., Cui C.Y., General report on Chinese migrant workers status and their development trends, Nature, 110, 5, pp. 113-122, (2009); Hao L.X., Cumulative causation of rural migration and initial peri-urbanization in China, Chin.

To test this research, we interviewed 4 major companies: Hyundai-Kia Motors, Samsung, LG and KT which are located in Seocho-gu and we performed bibliographic research on the related issues and the specialized business plan issued by Seocho-gu, cluster and RDT paper. Also, we joined a public hearing process. The basic assumption of RDT is that the behaviors of performers may be different according to resources in detail importance, control and discretion and concentration. In this case, we find performers lacking two factors: control and discretion and concentration. To be in the R & D special zone, like cluster, companies and SMEs are necessary as the main players of clusters. Seocho-gu office is one of the main actors. Inhabitants and SMEs of Seocho-gu are also important players. Also, we find some important resources that can be used for the involvement of the main players of the area. Deregulation of floor area ratio. By designation of the R & D specialized zone, the company or people who joined a specialized business plan can benefit from the deregulation of the floor area ratio to more than three times of the current floor area ratio. Political support. The head of the local government could be re-elected by the support of the citizens. Development merit. By designation, citizens who own property in the area can get benefit indirectly or directly. Government contribution. Some SMEs can get government contribution by the agency. This study finds that performers who lack two resource factors-control and discretion and concentration-join the plan positively. Through this research, RDT development is made. © Medwell Journals, 2018.","Deregulation; ICT cluster; Participant behavior; Plan; R & D special zone; Resource dependency theory","","","","","","Campling J.T., Michelson G., A strategic choice-resource dependence analysis of union mergers in the British and Australian broadcasting and film industries, J.

Research shows that very few corporations have the organizational capacity to practice corporate citizenship. Evidence exists that ever more corporations adopt programs of corporate citizenship development to increase this capacity. However, there still is a general lack of a strategicunderstanding of how corporate citizenship development occurs. The potential of OD frameworks and tools for developing corporate citizenship have been highlighted. Nevertheless, how OD practitioners develop corporate citizenship has not been studied empirically so far. Design/methodology/approach – A sociomaterial case study design was used. The work of six OD practitioners when developing corporate citizenship in one of the largest pharmaceutical corporations was studied over several months, based on interviews, observations and document analyses. Findings – The findings presented offer model practices of corporate citizenship development, in the form of five core strategies and five core behaviors that increase an organization’s capacity to practice corporate citizenship. Research limitations/implications – With this study, the notion of corporate citizenship development has become established as a distinct research area. The study might encourage further research in this important niche area. Practical implications – The findings have direct practical implications for at least seven different stakeholder groups.

Design/methodology/approach-By conducting a case study analysis of the city of Ghent, this study investigates how users are engaged in the development of mobile applications on a city-hosted platform. Findings-Findings show that public service delivery, related to the urban space, can be co-designed between the city and its citizens, if different toolkits aligned with the specific capacities and skills of the citizens are provided. Research limitations/implications-Data were collected between August 2012 and December 2013. Some preliminary findings are presented on the (design of the) dynamic co-creation ecosystem and the citizens’ capacities to participate on the city-hosted platform. In addition, while the examination is still ongoing some insights can be offered in the learning dynamics underpinning how the cities are setting up such a bottom-up process and how local participation for different citizen groups can be optimized in the context of design capabilities and the design space. Originality/value-This study yields relevant insights for policymakers, city administrations, as well as Living Lab practitioners into how public service delivery, supported by an inclusive participatory governance by design framework at the local level, can be co-designed between the city and citizens, if different toolkits aligned with the specific capacities and skills of the users are provided. By providing tailored tools, even ordinary citizens can take a much more active role in the development and appropriation of their urban space and generate solutions from which both the city and citizens’ everyday life can possibly benefit. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","(citizen) Developers;

It addresses the question ‘Is the Student Union a tokenism of student participation in school governance in the context of Hong Kong?’. The research adopts a mixed methodology comprising both quantitative and qualitative methods. For the quantitative study, 3209 valid student questionnaires from 51 secondary schools of different backgrounds were collected. For the qualitative study, four schools of different levels of student participation were involved in in-depth case studies. Semi-structured interviews and field observations with teachers and students were conducted to collect qualitative data. The study revealed that from the questionnaire, the ‘one student, one vote’ policy was an apparently fair, transparent and democratic procedure for Student Union elections, and gave the Student Union a positive image in relation to student participation. However, the in-depth case studies revealed that these were superficial perceptions. Instead, it was found that schools shared very limited powers with their Student Unions, where the Student Union would have power only in trivial school operational matters. The ultimate, real power was in the hands of school authorities, seriously limiting the influence of student participation. Our studies further revealed that whether students were satisfied with this disempowering situation or not, most of them had become ‘positive and passive’. This was because they had been socialized to accept the status quo, without expressing dissident voices, as they did not want to oppose the caring school ethos that they valued. In summary, Student Unions in Hong Kong are, in general, close to tokenism, a representative mechanism that cannot take meaningful action to bring forth genuine changes in important school matters. This may have negative impacts on students’ citizenship development, and ends up with cultivating students to be non-questioning, non-participatory, cynical, passive and docile citizens. © 2016 Intellect Ltd Article.","Civic education; Constructs of child; Here and now citizen; School civic mission; School governance; Student participation; Student Union","","","","","","Alderson P., School students views on school councils and daily life at school’, Children & Society, 14, 2, pp. 121-134, (2000); Amadeo J.A., Torney-Purta J., Lehmann R., Husfeldt V., Nikolova R., Civic Knowledge and Engagement: An IEA Study of Upper Secondary Students in Sixteen Countries, (2002); Backman E., Trafford B., Democratic Governance of Schools, (2006); Cox S., Robinson-Pant A., Enhancing participation in primary school and class councils through visual communication, Cambridge Journal of Education, 36, 4, pp. 515-532, (2006); Cummingham S., Lavalette M., Active citizens or “irresponsible truants”?

They often do so by collaborating in groups, for example through self-organized groups or government-induced open data engagement initiatives, such as hackathons. The successful use and engagement of OGD by groups of citizens can greatly contribute to the uptake and adoption of OGD in general. However, little is known regarding how groups of citizens develop in OGD engagement. This study aims at exploring and understanding the development stages of citizen groups in OGD engagement. To attain this objective, we conducted a comparative case study of group development stages in two different types of OGD engagement. Our cases show that leadership and diversity of capabilities significantly contribute to the success of citizen groups in OGD engagement. These findings suggest that connecting citizens having a diversity of expertise prior to the OGD engagement event helps to improve its effectiveness. This research is among the first to apply group development stages model in open data engagement studies and thus opening up new research opportunities concerning group developments in the open data literature. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2018.","Citizen engagement; Comparative case study; Government-induced; Group development; Hackathon; Open Government Data; Self-organized","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Citizen engagements; Comparative case study; Government-induced; Group development; Hackathon; Open Government Data; Self-organized; Government data processing","","","","","Safarov I., Meijer A., Grimmelikhuijsen S., Utilization of open government data: A systematic literature review of types, conditions, effects and users, Inf.

With the emergence and rapid development of sensor technologies, citizens potentially have more powerful tools to collect data and generate information to understand their living environment. Although sensor technologies are developing fast, citizen sensing has not been widely implemented yet and published studies are only a few. In this paper, we analyse the practical experiences from an implementation of citizen sensing for urban environment monitoring. A bottom-up model in which citizens develop and use sensors for environmental monitoring is described and assessed. The paper focuses on a case study of Amsterdam Smart Citizens Lab using NO2 sensors for air quality monitoring. We found that the bottom-up citizen sensing is still challenging but can be successful with open cooperation and effective use of online and offline facilities. Based on the assessment, suggestions are proposed for further implementations and research. © 2016 Qijun Jiang et al.","","Sensors; Air quality monitoring; Bottom up models; Environmental Monitoring; Living environment; Practical experience; Research domains; Sensor technologies; Urban environments; Air quality","","","","","Kolb C.E., Herndon S.C., Mcmanus J.B., Et al., Mobile laboratory with rapid response instruments for real-time measurements of urban and regional trace gas and particulate distributions and emission source characteristics, Environmental Science & Technology, 38, 21, pp. 5694-5703, (2004); Schnebele E., Cervone G., Kumar S., Waters N., Real time estimation of the calgary floods using limited remote sensing data, Water, 6, 2, pp. 381-398, (2014); Zhang J., Howard K., Langston C., Et al., National mosaic and multi-sensor QPE (NMQ) system: Description, results, and future plans, Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 92, 10, pp. 1321-1338, (2011); Werner-Allen G., Et al., Monitoring volcanic eruptions with a wireless sensor network, Proceedings of the 2nd European Workshop OnWireless SensorNetworks (EWSN'05), pp. 108-120, (2005); Mead M.I., Popoola O.A.M., Stewart G.B., Et al., The use of electrochemical sensors formonitoring urban air quality in lowcost, high-density networks, Atmospheric Environment, 70, pp. 186-203, (2013); Hasenfratz D., Saukh O., Thiele L., On-the-fly calibration of low-cost gas sensors, Wireless Sensor Networks: 9th European Conference, EWSN 2012, 7158, pp. 228-244, (2012); Samarajiva R., Mobilizing information and communications technologies for effective disaster warning: Lessons from the 2004 tsunami, NewMedia and Society, 7, 6, pp. 731-747, (2005); Kelman I., Warning for the 26 December 2004 tsunamis, Disaster Prevention and Management, 15, 1, pp. 178-189, (2006); Zerger A., Viscarra Rossel R.A., Swain D.L., Et al., Environmental sensor networks for vegetation, animal and soil sciences, International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation, 12, 5, pp. 303-316, (2010); Akyildiz I.F., Su W., Sankarasubramaniam Y., Cayirci E., Wireless sensor networks: A survey, Computer Networks, 38, 4, pp. 393-422, (2002); Corke P., Wark T., Jurdak R., Hu W., Valencia P., Moore D., Environmental wireless sensor networks, Proceedings of the IEEE, 98, 11, pp. 1903-1917, (2010); Hemmi A., Graham I., Hacker science versus closed science: Building environmental monitoring infrastructure, Information Communication and Society, 17, 7, pp. 830-842, (2014); Bell S., Cornford D., Bastin L., The state of automated amateur weather observations, Weather, 68, 2, pp. 36-41, (2013); Sullivan B.L., Wood C.L., Iliff M.J., Bonney R.E., Fink D., Kelling S., EBird: A citizen-based bird observation network in the biological sciences, Biological Conservation, 142, 10, pp. 2282-2292, (2009); Delaney D.G., Sperling C.D., Adams C.S., Leung B., Marine invasive species: Validation of citizen science and implications for nationalmonitoring networks, Biological Invasions, 10, 1, pp. 117-128, (2008); Wilderman C.C., Models of community science: Design lessons from the field, Proceedings of the Citizen Science Toolkit Conference, (2007); Morzy M., ICT Services for open and citizen science, World Wide Web, 18, 4, pp. 1147-1161, (2015); Cooper C.B., Dickinson J., Phillips T., Bonney R., Citizen science as a tool for conservation in residential ecosystems, Ecology and Society, 12, 2, (2007); Horn C.V.D., Boonstra R., Eindrapportage Smart Citizen Kit Amsterdam Meten IsWeten?, (2014); Hasenfratz D., Saukh O., Walser C., Et al., Deriving high-resolution urban air pollution maps using mobile sensor nodes, Pervasive and Mobile Computing, 16, pp. 268-285, (2015); Balestrini M., Diez T., Marshall P., Gluhak A., Rogers Y., IoT community technologies: Leaving users to their own devices or orchestration of engagement?, EAI Endorsed Transactions on Internet OfThings, 15, 1, (2015)","Q.

Being as basis of comfort life zone formation and important element of Smart Cities, social infrastructure facilities are practically considered by the developers often as project elements impairing effectiveness indicators of their activities. The purpose of the article is the justification of methodological approach to effective implementation of construction projects for social infrastructure development respecting the interests of main participants of investment and construction project: city, citizen, developers. Methodological approach deals with infrastructure facilities within the framework of urban blocks on the base of Smart Cities concept. The article articulates the concept of social infrastructure of urban blocks including condominiums with everyday serviced facilities on the ground floors and yard representing a private territory with landscaping, leisure and recreation grounds and fire lanes and which is accessible predominantly to inhabitants of particular block and which is closed to the public visit. Effective implementation of construction projects for social infrastructure development suggests creation of value innovation (basic element of blue ocean strategy) by means of transformation of so-called strategic canvas for social infrastructure facilities. Multifactor model for projects for social infrastructure development including each element's contribution to creation of additional value to customer was formed on the base of the method of expert assessments. It is presented mechanism of complex effectiveness assessment of decisions on value innovation for social infrastructure facilities respecting the interests of participants of investment and construction process. This mechanism can be used both for projects suggesting exclusively budgetary financing and for commercial projects. It was created an algorithm of practical implementation of stated methodological approach within the frames of Smart City concept. Risks to implementation of methodological way of their reduction were analyzed. Offers stated in the article are aimed to increase the effectiveness of implementation of construction projects within the frames of urban blocks when simultaneous quality improvement of life sphere takes place. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Budget control; Facilities; Floors; Investments; Smart city; Value engineering; Commercial projects; Construction process; Construction projects; Effectiveness assessment; Effectiveness indicators; Methodological approach; Quality improvement; Social infrastructure; Economic and social effects","","","","","Kankhva V., IOP Conf.

In this article, I explore the “part of virtue and prudence” Aristotle believes necessary for a multitude to participate in political life. I argue, first, that military service helps citizens develop the “part of virtue” necessary for political participation and, second, that the “part of prudence” Aristotle has in mind is sunesis. I argue, moreover, that military virtue helps citizens acquire sunesis and guides its exercise. Aristotle recognizes the limitations and potential dangers of military virtue and attempts to avoid these, in part by offering a new understanding of military virtue to offset the Spartan. Understanding the “part of virtue and prudence” citizens have helps understand their role in a polity but also points to how those citizens, and their regime, can be improved. © 2014, SAGE Publications.

This broad and complex challenge necessitates the continued investigation of innovative interdisciplinary approaches for engineering and construction education. The 360 degree model for educating socially responsible global citizens developed by the authors (360 Global Ed model) addresses these current needs through a structured approach for developing students as global citizens through purposeful engagement. The 360 Global Ed model includes a theoretical framework, educational environment, academic coursework, and outcomes. At the core of the model is an international service learning experience. The service-learning component provides a collaborative, interdisciplinary classroom environment combined with an authentic international field experience. Four years of a mix-methods research assessment demonstrate outstanding results on the impact of student learning in the areas of global citizenship, personal and professional growth, and cultural intelligence. The authors have also observed challenges when working in an international environment in interdisciplinary student teams. This paper provides a background on the need for globalization, social responsibility and service learning in engineering and construction management education, introduces the 360 Global Ed model for educating socially responsible global citizens, and discusses assessment results on the impact of student learning. Additionally, the paper addresses observed challenges to an interdisciplinary international service course approach and provides curricular responses to those challenges. © 2018 ASCE.","","Economic and social effects;

In the same month, an influx of social media activism occurred in response to the crisis, with citizens developing hashtag campaigns such as #FlintFwd in order to disseminate news and stories from a citizen’s perspective; these campaigns often positioned Flint positively ‒ as a recovering community ‒ rather than a city in the middle of a public health crisis, and often addressed not a national public but a local audience. This paper considers Flint-based social media activity to investigate the emergence of place-based activism within the ostensibly global network of social media. In doing so, it identifies three key themes; 1) leveraging social media to forward a critique of deficient journalistic storytelling; 2) using the affective process of storytelling via social media to claim authority over their own material offline existence, and 3) using place-based storytelling to implicate others as witnesses via the global network of social media. These themes coalesce around a distinctly critical logic of connectivity. This logic extends the notion of connectivity articulated by Van Dijck and Poell [2013. Understanding social media logic. Media and Communication, 1(1), 2–14.] and the strategies of platform activism explored by Tufekci [2017. Twitter and tear gas: The power and fragility of networked protest. New Haven: Yale University Press.] to explain how social media works to expose discrepancies between the public story of the water crisis and material, lived conditions of Flint, rendering visible a discursive identity of Flint thus far unrecognized. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","connectivity;

Explored through this analysis are the language, metaphors, logic, and rhetorical devices used by various news media reporting on educational concerns, and in particular the concerns revolving around teacher quality and teacher preparation, which allow the construction and circulation of specific kinds of knowledge and assert certain kinds of truths. This analysis is guided by the premise that education writ large, which includes the profession of teaching as well as the field of teacher preparation, is charged with helping students, our youngest citizens, develop an understanding of the practices and problems of people-power, self-rule, and shared governance in our democratic society.

Yet if citizenship is conceived of as a practice, children can be firmly seen as citizens in the sense that they are social actors, negotiating and contributing to relationships of social interdependence. This article develops understandings of children's agency in citizenship and some of the different ways in which children's actions enact them as interdependent citizens. It presents one aspect of the understanding of citizenship generated from research with six groups of marginalized children, aged 5-13, in Wales and France. Synthesizing the research groups' descriptions of activities they associated with the component parts of citizenship with citizenship theory, these children can be seen to engage in actions of citizenship that include making rules of social existence, furthering social good and exercising freedoms to achieve their own rights. Their activities also transgress the boundaries of existing balances of rights, responsibilities and statuses, through their (mis)behaviour, in ways that can be interpreted as Acts of citizenship. In children's everyday activities, however, the distinction between actions and Acts of citizenship can at times be blurred. This is because recognizing aspects of children's practices as citizenship is a challenge to dominant definitions of citizenship, and claims a new status for children. Exploring children's citizenship in these ways has the potential to widen understandings of participation and appreciation of broader aspects of children's agency in citizenship. © The Author(s) 2013.","Acts of citizenship; agency; children's citizenship; participation; social justice","","","","","","Alderson P., Ethical Research with Children, (2005); Alderson P., A Handbook of Children and Young People's Participation: Perspectives from Theory and Practice, (2010); Arendt H., The Human Condition, (1998); Ben-Arieh A., Boyer Y., Citizenship and childhood, Childhood, 12, 1, pp. 33-53, (2005); Boyden J., Ennew J., Children in Focus: A Manual for Participatory Research with Children, (1997); Castro L.R., The 'good-enough society', the 'good-enough citizen' and the 'good enough student': Where is children's participation agenda moving to in Brazil?, Childhood, 19, 1, pp. 52-68, (2012); Cockburn T., Children and citizenship in Britain: A case for an interdependent model of citizenship, Childhood, 5, 1, pp. 99-117, (1998); Cockburn T., Children, fooles and madmen': Children's relationship to citizenship in Britain from Thomas Hobbes to Bernard Crick, International Journal of Theory and Research in Education, 10, 4, pp. 65-84, (1999); Cockburn T., Children and the feminist ethic of care, Childhood, 12, 1, pp. 71-89, (2005); Cockburn T., Partners in power: A radically pluralistic form of participative democracy for children and young people, Children and Society, 21, 1, pp. 446-457, (2007); Cohen E.F., Neither seen nor heard: Children's citizenship in contemporary democracies, Citizenship Studies, 9, 2, pp. 221-240, (2005); Corbin J., Strauss A.L., Basics of Qualitative Research: Techniques and Procedures for Developing Grounded Theory, (2008); Cruickshank J., Realism and Sociology: Anti-Foundationalism, Ontology and Social Research, (2003); Delanty G., Citizenship in the Global Age: Culture, Society and Politics, (2000); Devine D., Children's citizenship and the structuring of adult-child relations in the primary school, Childhood, 9, 3, pp. 303-320, (2002); Towards an EU Strategy on the Rights of the Child, (2006); Faulks K., Citizenship, (2000); Franks M., Pockets of participation: Revisiting child-centred participation research, Children and Society, 25, 1, pp. 15-25, (2011); Freire P., Pedagogy of the Oppressed, (1973); Hart R., Children's Participation from Tokenism to Citizenship, (1992); Isin E.F., Acts of Citizenship, (2008); Isin E.F., Citizenship in flux: The figure of the activist citizen, Subjectivities, 29, pp. 367-388, (2009); Isin E.F., Turner B.S., Investigating citizenship: An agenda for citizenship studies, Citizenship Studies, 11, 1, pp. 5-17, (2007); Jans M., Children as citizens: Towards a contemporary notion of child participation, Childhood, 11, 1, pp. 27-44, (2004); Kennelly J., Llewellyn K.R., Educating for active compliance: Discursive constructions in citizenship education, Citizenship Studies, 15, 6-7, pp. 897-914, (2011); Larkins C., Can the EU live up to the expectations of its child citizens?, International Journal of Children's Rights, 19, 3, pp. 451-476, (2011); Leonard M., What's recreational about 'recreational rioting'?

While deploying data and insights from a recently completed research project1 in England, which identified substantial tensions in intergenerational relationships in sport and coaching, the argument and analysis also invokes wider international concerns and more generally applicable implications for policy and practice. Drawing heuristically upon the philosophy of Dewey (2007 [1916]), it is recognized that the concept of citizenship as a form of social practice should seek to encourage the development of complementary traits and dispositions in young people. To develop socially and educationally thus entails engagement in meaningful social and cultural activity, of which one potentially significant component is participation in youth sport, both within and outside formal education. However, it is argued that any confident assumption that sporting and coaching contexts will necessarily foster positive traits and dispositions in young people should be considered dubious and misplaced. Deploying a Lacanian (1981) perspective to interpret our data, we contend that ‘liaisons’ and interactions between coaches and young people are often treated suspiciously, and regarded as potentially ‘dangerous’. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Dewey; Lacan; policy; risk; sports coaching","","","","","","Armour K., Sandford R., Positive youth development through an outdoor physical activity programme: evidence from a four-year evaluation, Educational review, 65, 1, pp. 85-108, (2013); Ashley J., London 2012: Britain’s Olympic gold rush provides a lesson for politics.

It is against this background that, in recent years, many interventions have been developed to address social isolation among the elderly. Evaluative studies show that most interventions are hardly effective, though. An important reason for this is the heterogeneity of the socially isolated. This article offers insight into this heterogeneity by presenting a typology with different profiles of socially isolated older adults and the intervention implications of this typology. The typology is derived from an extensive qualitative study on socially isolated elderly individuals in the Netherlands. The typology imposes some degree of order to a diversity of circumstances, ambitions, and possibilities of the socially isolated elderly, thereby deepening the understanding of the heterogeneity of this population. The definition of social isolation used in this study starts from a societal angle of incidence, namely the current policy context of Western European welfare states, in which governments emphasize the importance of independence and self-reliance of their citizens. Developed from that perspective, the typology provides a theoretical basis for applying interventions aimed at increasing self-reliance of social isolated elderly. This perspective on social isolation also has consequences for the way in which the effectiveness of interventions to alleviate social isolation is assessed.

Methodology: A qualitative study was conducted. Data from semi-structured interviews with teachers from eight schools were analysed using thematic analysis. Findings and implications: Data analysis revealed an emphasis on offering a participatory experience. Five elements of critical democratic citizenship were commonly advanced in mock election related education in these schools. Teacher narratives also revealed how teachers had different understandings about political identity and their role in advancing identity development. Findings suggest that there is ample opportunity to intensify attention to CDC-development in education related to mock elections in Dutch schools. Further research into students’ political identity development processes during political simulations in different political and educational contexts is required to further academic debate about desirable support by teachers and governments in high-quality political education projects. © 2017, Bielefeld University.

Qualitative research design was used in this study. The data of this study were collected by data collection form including two questions. The results of the study showed that the prospective teachers generally perceive the history as an objective science. It was observed that the students have nationalist-conservative perspective. Also, it was seen that preservice teachers generally emphasize the history as learning from the past and directing to the future in terms of the results regarding the views towards history teaching. Besides this, the pre-service teachers stated that the purpose of history teaching is improving national identity and consciousness. Contrary to this, the pre-service teachers did not mention some purposes of history teaching, such as raising effective citizens, developing democratic perspective, creative thinking, and historical thinking. © Kamla-Raj 2015.","History perceptions; History teachers; Purpose of history teaching; Social studies teachers","","","","","","Acun F., Tarihteobje ktifliktartismasi, Muhafazakar Dusunce, 2, 7, pp. 109-125, (2006); Barton K.C., Narrative simplifications in elementary students' historical thinking, Advances in Research on Teaching: Teaching and Learning History, pp. 51-83, (1996); Barton K.C., Levstik L.S., They still use of their past: Historical salience in elementary children's chronological thinking, American Educational Research Journal, 28, pp. 531-576, (1996); Biklen S.K., Casella R., A Practical Guide to the Qualitative Dissertation, (2007); Carr E.H., Tarih Nedir?, (2002); Collingwood R.G., Tarih Tasarimi, (1996); Creswell J.W., Qualitative Inquiry and the Research Design: Choosing among Five Approaches., (2007); Culha B., 12-14 Yas Grubu Ogrencilerinin Tarihsel Dusunmelerini Gelistirmede Tarihsel Kanit Kullanimi., (2010); Davis M.E., How Students Understand the Past: From Theory to Practice, (2005); Demircioglu I.H., Tarih Ogretiminde Ogrenci Merkezli Yaklasimlar, (2005); Downey M., Levstik L.S., Teaching and learning history: The research base, Handbook of Research in Social Studies, (1991); Hobsbawm E.J., Tarih Uzerine, (1999); Hofstadter A., Generality and singularity in historical judgment, The Journal of Philosophy, 42, 3, pp. 57-65, (1945); Husbands C., What is History Teaching?

On one hand, teaching civic education has never been ranked high in the education agenda. On the other hand, because of the conservative nature of schools, students are rarely encouraged to participate in school governance for the enhancement of their citizenship development. Funded by the General Research Fund (GRF) in Hong Kong, the authors conducted a quantitative survey on students’ participation in school governance and their citizenship development in 2013 to explore 1) students’ conception of “good citizens”; 2) the level and scope of student participation in school governance; and 3) the facilitating and hindering factors influencing student participation. This paper is a report on the simple statistical results of the survey findings. With reference to Westheimer and Kahne’s typologies, the findings revealed that the students had an eclectic understanding of citizenship, with higher scores for Personally Responsible Citizen and lower scores for Participatory, Justice Oriented and Patriotic Citizen, reflecting a conservative orientation. Concerning the implementation of school civic mission through student participation in school governance, it was found that students were rarely allowed to engage in important school matters, such as formulation of school rules and discussion of the school development plan. Our findings also revealed that schools were more inclined to inform students and consult them rather than confer real participation and powers to them. The paper concludes that the current practice of student participation in school governance does not facilitate the nurturing of active participatory citizens, particularly of a Justice Oriented nature, and this is urgently needed for the democratic development of Hong Kong. © JSSE 2014.","Civic education; School civic mission; School governance; School-based management; Students’ participation","","","","","","Amadeo J.A., Torney-Purta J., Lehmann R., Husfeldt V., Nikolova R., Civic Knowledge and Engagement: An IEA Study of Upper Secondary Students in Sixteen Countries, Amsterdam: IEA, (2002); Assor A., Kaplan H., Roth G., Choice is Good, but Relevance is Excellent: Autonomy-enhancing and Suppressing Teacher Behaviours Predicting Students' Engagement in Schoolwork, British Journal of Educational Psychology, 72, 2, pp. 261-278, (2002); Backman E., Trafford B., Democratic Governance of Schools, (2006); Banks J.A., Diversity, Group Identity, and Citizenship Education in a Global Age.

I argue that ""diversity talk"" has not been effective in civic spheres because it does not challenge the underlying pluralist architecture of the US political system. Instead, diversity in the civic sphere is regarded as producing conflict or an apolitical ""improvement in manners"" (Rorty 1999) rather than as a mechanism for citizenship development.

A recent complementary explanation has highlighted the role of politics to create regionally orientated support. We combine these two explanations by studying what determines the support for decentralization in Spain, an almost unique case where these two approaches can be tested. Using a hierarchical model, we show that in those regions without a different subnational identity, some citizens develop regionally orientated support because of their wish to bring the administration closer to the citizens and because their preferred party is pushing for further decentralization. In addition, we highlight the importance of considering decentralization as an outcome derived from party dynamics, which are able to shape political attitudes towards decentralization. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Decentralization; hierarchical model; political competition; regional identification","Spain; administrative framework; citizenship; decentralization; hierarchical system; national identity; party politics; political discourse; political geography","","","","","Alesina A., Spolaore E., Wacziarg R., Economic Integration and Political Disintegration, American Economic Review, 90, 5, pp. 1276-1296, (2000); Amat F., Falco-Gimeno A., Legislative Bargaining and Decentralization: Evidence for 15 OECD Parliamentary Democracies, (2010); Amat F., Jurado I., Leon S., A Political Theory of Decentralization Dynamics, Estudios/Working Papers, (2009); Anderson C.D., Economic Voting and Multilevel Governance: A Comparative Individual-Level Analysis, American Journal of Political Science, 50, 2, pp. 449-463, (2006); Baun M., Marek D., Regional Policy and Decentralization in the Czech Republic, Regional & Federal Studies, 16, 4, pp. 409-428, (2006); Beramendi P., Anderson C.J., Democracy, Inequality, and Representation: A Comparative Perspective, (2008); Bird R.M., Vaillancourt F., Fiscal Decentralization in Developing Countries, (1998); Bolton P., Roland G., The Breakup of Nations: A Political Economy Analysis, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 112, 4, pp. 1057-1090, (1997); Bryk A.S., Raudenbush S.W., Hierarchical Linear Models: Applications and Data Analysis Methods, (2002); Cole A., Decentralization in France: Central Steering, Capacity Building and Identity Construction, French Politics, 4, 1, pp. 31-57, (2006); Coller X., Castello R., Las Bases Sociales de la Identidad Dual: El Caso Valenciano, Revista Española de Investigaciones Sociológicas, 88, pp. 155-183, (1999); Colomer J.M., The Spanish 'State of Autonomies': Non-institutional Federalism, West European Politics, 21, 4, pp. 40-52, (1998); Crook R., Manor J., Democratic Decentralization, (2000); De Winter L., Tursan H., Regionalist Parties in Western Europe, (1998); Diez Medrano J., Framing Europe: Attitudes to European Integration in Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom, (2003); Erk J., Swenden W., The New Wave of Federalism Studies, New Directions Federalism Studies, pp. 2-24, (2009); Giordano B., Italian Regionalism or 'Padanian' Nationalism-The Political Project of the Lega Nord in Italian Politics, Political Geography, 19, 4, pp. 445-471, (2000); Gourevitch P.A., The Reemergence of 'Peripheral Nationalisms': Some Comparative Speculations on the Spatial Distribution of Political Leadership and Economic Growth, Comparative Studies in Society and History, 21, 3, pp. 303-322, (1979); Goyder J., Measuring Social Identities: Problems and Progress, International Journal of Public Opinion Research, 15, 2, pp. 180-191, (2003); Guibernau M., National Identity, Devolution and Secession in Canada, Britain and Spain, Nations and Nationalism, 12, 1, pp. 51-76, (2006); Hooghe L., Marks G., Schakel A., The Rise of Regional Authority: A Comparative Study of 42 Democracies, (2010); Horowitz D.L., A Democratic South Africa?: Constitutional Engineering in a Divided Society, (1992); Kalin R., Berry J.W., Ethnic and Multicultural Attitudes, Ethnicity and Culture in Canada: The Research Landscape, pp. 292-321, (1994); Kam C.D., Franzese Jr. R.J., Modeling and Interpreting Interactive Hypotheses in Regression Analysis, (2007); Kaufmann C., Possible and Impossible Solutions to Ethnic Civil Wars, International Security, 20, 4, pp. 136-175, (1996); Keating M., Territorial Competition and Political Restructuring in Western Europe, Sustainability and Development.

Through community awareness students understand their roles and responsibility as active citizens. Research has discovered that as critical pedagogy service-learning still lacks the ability to claim for developing real community awareness among students. This paper had two aims: first to evaluate the claim of service-learning on students’ community awareness development and second, to assess the ability of service-learning to promote students’ citizenship development. For this purpose, this paper investigated into the current literature on how service-learning provides real community based learning opportunities to the students in order to achieve these goals. Exploration of the existing literature revealed that despite of being termed as a time-consuming and expensive practice, service-learning has the potential to develop citizenship propensities of students as well as creation of community awareness. The review revealed that servicelearning achieves these two goals on the basis of its characteristic of reciprocity. The paper concludes that as a critical pedagogy service-learning plays an important role in developing students’ community awareness and citizenship development. © MCSER-Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.","Citizenship development;

It draws on the example of the Schiphol Airport case, where citizens developed a bottom-up system for tracking and reporting noise after the Dutch Minister of Transport, Public Works and Water Management responded to their complaints about expanding the airport with the statement that ‘Noise cannot be measured’. Despite the State’s position of no adverse effects on the inhabitants’ well-being, local residents started reporting ailments ostensibly linked to the increase in noise pollution. The central questions this contribution addresses are: how did lay people living near Schiphol use citizen sensing to respond to the risk represented by the increase in noise? How did this bottom-up initiated monitoring intertwine with the traditional top-down governance of the risk? The interplay between four theoretical concepts related to the case (citizen sensing, risk governance, lay people and social accountability) serves as a lens of observation for analysing the case. The ultimate goal is to assess whether ‘pure’ citizen sensing, only recognized by the institutional system at a later stage, can succeed in fostering social accountability of institutional actors to citizens exposed to a specific public health risk. © 2018 The Author(s).

The case study is contextualised through the social unrest in Iceland and the e-PB initiative of the Citizens Foundation (CF) in Reykjavík, from which, in addition to other cases, such as Porto Alegre, Brazil, active citizens in Maribor drew knowledge and examples of good practices. The social and learning practices in the participatory democracy process were researched in five stages; however, mainly the findings from the semi-structured interviews are highlighted in this article. Our case study confirmed, similarly to the pioneer work of Schugurensky and his colleagues, that interviewees acquired instrumental and technical knowledge about politics and citizenship; developed analytical, leadership, and deliberative skills; and, even more importantly, translated the new understanding, abilities, and dispositions into new social practices and behaviours.

This article traces the history of that relationship in Indonesia over the last two hundred years. At first, a central colonial state with insufficient resources to enforce its will negotiated halfway accords with a host of local rulers. Villagers ‘belonged’ to their patrimonial ruler, with the choice to submit or run away. By the early twentieth century, the state began to develop its technical means to bring about major economic and social changes, but only in densely populated areas with agrarian potential. Capitalism there began to disrupt village life and loosen clientelistic bonds. An indigenous constituency emerged for relatively autonomous citizenship. After independence in 1945, state politics there were (left-)populist rather than liberal. Where the state had fewer interests, however, the central state presence remained thin. The nineteenth century halfway house was reinvented and stabilized. Local leaders more easily gained monopolistic control over economic resources, allowing them to enforce clientelistic forms of citizenship. Central state elites were happy to grant local autonomy there, since it also relieved them from direct citizen pressure on their own prerogatives. © 2018 The Author(s).

This submission makes the case for why the issue of 'development' should be studied in more detail in e-Government research and aims to clarify the conceptualization and understanding of 'development' as it pertains to the use of ICTs in the digital government domain, drawing upon literature in two related research domains: Digital Divide and ICT for Development (ICT4D). E-Government research currently cuts short at understanding factors that affect the adoption and implementation of e-Government initiatives and tends to converse around the concept of 'development' at a general level. The literature in Digital Divide and ICT4D overcomes some of the perceived shortcomings of the e-Government literature, largely the issue of development in relation to citizens and the importance of considering context in more detail. By undertaking research using a case study approach within the UK and Tanzania, the proposed study will help to understand the impact of e-Government initiatives on citizens' development and what this actually means over a longer period of time beyond the implementation stage. Such understanding is important to ensure that the very goals of e-Government initiatives are realised in relation to the context in which initiatives are deployed. By understanding from the e-Government perspective what development equates to and how it could possibly be measured can help in the design and rollout of future initiatives and can be considered to be positive steps towards achieving the UN's Millennium Development Goals. © 2018 is held by the owner/author(s).","Development; Digital divide; EGov; Electronic government; ICT4D","Computer applications; Computer programming; Development; Digital divide; EGov; Electronic government; ICT4D; Government data processing","","","","","Agrawal A.K., Catalini C., Goldfarb A., Some simple economics of crowdfunding, Innov.

Developing countries are funded by various bodies/developed countries to implement successful e-government projects to serve this need. However, in Sri Lanka most of the completed e-government systems are not being used by the end users, thus e-government projects' sustainability is a major concern. In this research we analyse four e-government projects; two successes and two failures to derive factors affecting the sustainability of a project. It was identified that approach, method of deployment and user involvement are the critical success factors for e-government sustainability. We acknowledge that the approach should be bottom-up, method should be incremental and it is important to interact with all the stakeholders in each phase. With this we derive a framework for sustainability of e-government projects. D. Malshika P. Dias, Kasuni Weerasinghe, Nihal D.

The study aim was to elicit stakeholder priorities for the message content of an education program to improve dementia awareness among youth; specifically, what do children need to know about dementia?Methods: A qualitative inquiry using interviews and focus groups was used. Purposive sampling achieved maximum variation in dementia experience and participant characteristics. Focus groups with Scouts in the community aged 9-12 years old (n = 22) used innovative techniques to explore children's attitudes towards people with dementia. Participants with personal experience of dementia were five people with early-stage dementia; 12 adult primary carers; four non-primary carers; and six grandchildren of a person with dementia. They were asked what is important for children to understand about dementia and what attitudes they may like an education program to confer. Content analysis was performed using NVivo10.Results: Strong themes to emerge were that children need to know the whole truth about dementia; that individuals with dementia are still people, that it is not the fault of the person with dementia; and that dementia is different and typically unpredictable for everyone. Discussions also indicated a need to educate children about ways to relate to a person with dementia, and to appreciate positives within a relationship.Conclusions: Children are our future citizens. Developing an education program for children with this message content may be fundamental to de-stigmatizing dementia and laying the foundation to dementia-friendly communities. © 2018 International Psychogeriatric Association.","attitudes;

This article examines the theory that the dissatisfaction and disengagement citizens develop toward one government agency can extend to an alternative agency. Leveraging police precinct-level data on 311 calls and criminal complaints from 2004 to 2012 in New York City, it investigates whether government responsiveness to municipal issues predicts citizens’ willingness to submit criminal complaints to the police. The study finds that predictors of disengagement with law enforcement extend beyond negative interactions with law enforcement alone. Rather, the time it takes local government officials to fix a 311 request for services, such as filling potholes and abating noise, shapes the likelihood that residents will file misdemeanor criminal complaints. Thus policymakers must account for the policy environment beyond their agency’s domain to alleviate citizens’ dissatisfaction and disengagement with government overall. © 2018 SAGE Publications.","Bureaucratic governance; Civic engagement; Law enforcement; Participation; Service provision","","","","","","Levi M., Social and Unsocial Capital: A Review Essay of Robert Putnam’s Making Democracy Work, Politics & Society, 24, 1, (1996); Putnam R.D., Making Democracy Work: Civic Traditions in Modern Italy, (1993); Diamond L.J., Morlino L., An Overview, Journal of Democracy, 15, 4, pp. 20-31, (2004); Campbell A.L., Policy Makes Mass Politics, Annual Review of Political Science, 15, pp. 333-351, (2012); Pierson P., When Effect Becomes Cause: Policy Feedback and Political Change, World Politics, 45, 4, pp. 595-628, (1993); Schneider A., Ingram H., Social Construction of Target Populations: Implications for Politics and Policy, American Political Science Review, 87, 2, pp. 334-347, (1993); Lipset S.M., Schneider W., The Confidence Gap: Business, Labor, and Government in the Public Mind, (1983); Berman E.M., Dealing with Cynical Citizens, Public Administration Review, 57, 2, pp. 105-112, (1997); Whitaker G.P., Coproduction: Citizen Participation in Service Delivery, Public Administration Review, 40, 3, pp. 240-246, (1980); Fung A., Wright E.O., Deepening Democracy: Innovations in Empowered Participatory Governance, Politics & Society, 29, 1, pp. 5-41, (2001); O'Brien D.T., Offenhuber D., Baldwin-Philippi J., Sands M., Gordon E., Uncharted Territoriality in Coproduction: The Motivations for 311 Reporting, Journal of Public Administration Research & Theory, 27, 2, pp. 320-335, (2017); Fukuyama F., Social Capital, Civil Society and Development, Third World Quarterly, 22, 1, pp. 7-20, (2001); Diamond L.J., Three Paradoxes of Democracy, Journal of Democracy, 1, 3, pp. 48-60, (1990); Dehoog R.H., Lowery D., Lyons W.E., Citizen Satisfaction with Local Governance: A Test of Individual, Jurisdictional, and City-Specific Explanations, Journal of Politics, 52, 3, pp. 807-837, (1990); Whitaker, Coproduction: Citizen Participation in Service Delivery; Skocpol T., Fiorina M.P., Making Sense of the Civic Engagement Debate, Civic Engagement in American Democracy, pp. 1-23, (1999); Verba S., Nie N., Participation in America: Political Democracy and Social Equality, (1972); Why People Obey the Law, (1990); Thomas J., Citizen-Initiated Contacts with Government Agencies: A Test of Three Theories, American Journal of Political Science, 26, 3, (1982); Kuklinski J.H., Hurley N.L., On Hearing and Interpreting Political Messages: A Cautionary Tale of Citizen Cue-Taking, Journal of Politics, 56, 3, pp. 729-751, (1994); Pierson, When Effect Becomes Cause; Schneider, Ingram, Social Construction of Target Populations; Lind A., Tyler T., The Social Psychology of Procedural Justice, (1988); The Logic of Congressional Action, (1992); Soss J., Schram S.F., A Public Transformed?

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of parental involvement and socioeconomic status on teens digital citizenship, which includes: digital access, digital etiquette, and digital safety. A research-based path model was developed to explain causal relationships between these factors. This model was tested based on data gathered from 270 teens and their parents. The results provided significant evidence in support of the following hypothesized model: teens whose parents were more involved in their technology usage and online activities have higher reported levels of digital etiquette and digital safety; teens whose parents have better socioeconomic status have higher level of digital access, digital etiquette and digital safety. Overall, parental involvement and socioeconomic status was found to positively predict teen digital citizenship. The study findings have the potential for guiding future model development and to further influence positive social change by supporting parents and educators to promote online safety and digital citizenship development.","Digital citizenship;

As part of these debates, a number of theories have been developed to try to explain the emergence of cosmopolitan dispositions, and in particular, why some citizens develop these dispositions and others do not. This article seeks to refine these theories by testing their assumptions on a youth sample, by drawing on the findings of the wider youth socialisation literature, and by comparing the relative merits of different ‘sources’ of cosmopolitanism (namely cognitive engagement; contact with cultural Others; learning a foreign language; and exposure to discussions about international issues in the public and the private sphere). To do so, the analysis draws on data from the 2009 International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS) and its survey of young people aged 14. Using these data, this article will show that each of these theories are positively associated with cosmopolitan sources, but that the strength of these relationships is variable and that not all sources of cosmopolitan dispositions are equal. Based on these findings, this article will argue that schools can play an important role in cultivating cosmopolitan dispositions at this particular life stage. © 2015 The Author(s).

We designed an entire course rooted in the principles of action teaching in which students facilitated the positive effects of art, nature, and music on the well-being of individuals diagnosed with dementia. Groups of three students worked with a local elderly couple, one member of whom had dementia, to create multimedia digital projects (e.g., online scrapbooks, interactive DVDs) involving experiences with art or nature tailored to the needs of their specific community partners. Students met weekly with their assigned couple to discuss their families’ interests, goals for the project, and to obtain feedback on the impact of their project on their families’ well-being. Through these weekly meetings, students took an iterative approach to designing and improving their final projects, applying material learned through classroom lectures to their projects. In this field experience, students went beyond traditional lecture learning by developing a customized project that promoted the well-being of someone experiencing dementia. This course fostered values of citizenship, developed students’ research skills, and highlighted the reciprocal nature between knowledge learned in the classroom and knowledge acquired through real-world experiences. © 2014, PsychOpen.

An important question is to what extent schools can simultaneously promote different learning outcomes. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between language ability and youth citizenship. Using a representative sample of 2429 grade 6 pupils (age 11–13) in 138 primary schools in the Netherlands, our findings confirm that language ability is strongly associated with pupils’ youth citizenship outcomes, in particular with citizenship attitudes and knowledge. Contrary to popular belief, we conclude that stimulating pupils’ language development need not compete with investing in pupils’ citizenship development. Rather than a trade-off, our findings suggest a positive relationship between language ability and citizenship development. © 2016 The Author(s).

However, it is also important to explore variables influencing public value to pursue for attaining high public value from such projects. This paper aims to attempt to explore such variables based on Situation-Actor-Process (S-A-P) framework. In India, physical presence of citizens is still required at many public centers established for delivering a variety of government services. A citizen at the time of his visit to a public service center faces a situation, deals with different actors and is subjected to a set of processes. At the end of the service cycle, the citizen develops a perception about public value of the e-governance project. The paper aims at exploring the likely influence of “Improved Situation”, “Capability Level of Actors” and “Flexible Process Workflow” on “Public Value” of e-governance projects. Design/methodology/approach: On the basis of a review of literature, variables likely to be influencing public value have been identified in terms of situation, actors and processes. A questionnaire was designed, and a survey conducted to measure public value and S-A-P-related variables in the context of two e-governance projects, namely, Passport Seva Project and Driving License Project in India. Survey data have been analyzed to study the influence of S-A-P-related variables on the public value of e-governance projects. Learning issues have been synthesized in terms of implications for practitioners as well as researchers for enhancing public value of e-governance projects. Findings: The study has revealed that a citizen-centric e-governance project with observed high value of conceptualized S-A-P variables is expected to be characterized by high public value. The analysis has also reflected upon a need for an in-depth study to explore empirically validated linkages between S-A-P variables and public value of e-governance projects. Research limitations/implications: The paper is based on a pilot study in the context of two citizen-centric e-governance projects. It is required to study more such projects for the purpose of validating the proposed framework and arriving at generalized findings. Practical implications: The study results are expected to sensitize practitioners to keep in view conceptualized variables related to situation, actors and processes while planning for citizen-centric e-governance projects. This may result in improved situation at the public service centers, better performance of employees and more flexible processes which may further help to increase the public value of such projects. Practical implications: E-governance projects can perform a vital role in improving public value. In the context of India, a key objective of e-governance projects is to improve the service delivery of citizen-centric projects. The findings of the pilot study, based on the select two citizen-centric e-governance projects in India, reflect upon the likely relationship between public value and S-A-P variables. Thrust on improving situational aspects, as conceptualized in this study, is expected to improve comfort level of citizens while taking benefit of IT enabled services of government organizations. Better capability of actors at public organizations is likely to build trust and confidence among citizens toward these services. Adoption of flexible processes by public organizations is expected to ensure seamless delivery of services to citizens through alternate options. Enhanced delivery of services satisfies the need for improved public value and create positive attitude among society toward public organizations. It contributes to satisfaction level of citizens in terms of saving of time, money and efforts. Originality/value: A review of literature has revealed a few studies undertaken in recent past with focus on measurement of public value in e-governance context. This paper is based on a novel idea of exploring the likely relationship between conceptualized S-A-P-related variables and public value of citizen-centric e-governance projects. Recommendations based on learning issues are expected to trigger suitable interventions to generate high public value from such projects. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","E-governance; E-government; Public value of e-governance projects; SAP-LAP","","","","","","Agus A., Barker S., Kandampully J., An exploratory study of service quality in the Malaysian public service sector, International Journal of Quality & Reliability Management, 24, 2, pp. 177-190, (2007); Ahmad S.A., Latif I.A., The effectiveness of public advisory services: what are the important factors?, International Journal of Business and Management, 7, 23, pp. 19-30, (2012); Al-Borie M.H., Damanhouri S.M.A., Patients' satisfaction of service quality in Saudi hospitals: a SERVQUAL analysis, International Journal of Health Care Quality Assurance, 26, 1, pp. 20-30, (2013); Axelsson K., Melin U., Lindgren I., Exploring the importance of citizen participation and involvement in e-government projects; practice, incentives, and organization, Transforming Government: People, Process and Policy, 4, 4, pp. 299-321, (2010); Belwal R., Zoubi A.K., Public centric e-governance in Jordan, a field study of people’s perception of e-governance awareness, corruption, and trust, Journal of Information, Communication & Ethics in Society, 6, 4, pp. 317-333, (2008); Bharwani S., Jauhari V., An exploratory study of competencies required to co-create memorable customer experiences in the hospitality industry, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 25, 6, pp. 823-843, (2013); Bhattacharya D., Gulla U., Gupta M.P., E-service quality model for Indian government portals: citizens' perspective, Journal of Enterprise Information Management, 25, 3, pp. 246-271, (2012); Bidyarthi H.M.J., Srivastava A.K., Citizens’ Perspectives of E-Governance, E-Governance in Practice, (2011); Brown G.L., Convenience in services marketing, Journal of Services Marketing, 4, 1, pp. 53-59, (1990); Brown T.J., Churchill G.A., Peter J.P., Improving the measurement of service quality, Journal of Retailing, 69, 1, pp. 127-139, (1993); Cavana R.Y., Corbett L.M.G., Lo Y.L., Developing zones of tolerance for managing passenger rail service quality, International Journal of Quality & Reliability Management, 24, 1, pp. 7-31, (2007); Charan P., Supply chain performance issues in an automobile company: a SAP-LAP analysis, Measuring Business Excellence, 16, 1, pp. 67-86, (2012); Chatzoglou P., Chatzoudes D., Vraimaki E., Diamantidis A., Service quality in the public sector: the case of the citizen's service centers (CSCs) of Greece, International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management, 62, 6, pp. 583-605, (2013); Chauhan G., Singh T.P., Resource flexibility for lean manufacturing: SAP-LAP analysis of a case study, International Journal of Lean Six Sigma, 4, 4, pp. 370-388, (2013); Cordella A., Bonina M.C., A public value perspective for ICT-enabled public sector reforms: a theoretical reflection, Government Information Quarterly, 29, pp. 512-520, (2012); Dash B.C., Sangita S.N., Governance reforms in power sector: initiatives and outcomes in Orissa, (2011); Garg A., Deshmukh S.G., Engineering support issues for flexibility in maintenance, Asia Pacific Journal of Marketing and Logistics, 22, 2, pp. 247-270, (2010); Gauld R., Goldfinch S., Horsburgh S., Do they want?

This article examines these claims ethnographically and historically with an eye toward the kinds of social orders such practices produce. This article focuses on a hackathon, one emblematic site of social practice where techniques from information technology (IT) production become ways of remaking culture. Hackathons sometimes produce technologies, and they always, however, produce subjects. This article argues that the hackathon rehearses an entrepreneurial citizenship celebrated in transnational cultures that orient toward Silicon Valley for models of social change. Such optimistic, high-velocity practice aligns, in India, with middle-class politics that favor quick and forceful action with socially similar collaborators over the contestations of mass democracy or the slow construction of coalition across difference. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","citizenship; development; entrepreneurialism; futures; technology","","","","","","Abraham I., The Contradictory Spaces of Postcolonial Techno-science, Economic and Political Weekly, 41, 3, pp. 210-217, (2006); Adams V., Murphy M., Clarke A.E., Anticipation: Technoscience, Life, Affect, Temporality, Subjectivity, 28, 1, pp. 246-265, (2009); Adas M., Machines as the Measure of Men, (1989); Anderson C., The Internet Has Created a New Industrial Revolution, The Guardian, (2012); Aneesh A., Virtual Migration: The Programming of Globalization, (2006); Azam M., Chin A., Prakash N., The Returns to English-language Skills in India, (2010); Baviskar A., Sinha S., Philip K., Rethinking Indian Environmentalism: Industrial Pollution in Delhi and Fisheries in Kerala, Forging Environmentalism: Justice, Livelihood, and Contested Environments, pp. 189-256, (2006); Blom Hansen T., The Saffron Wave: Democracy and Hindi Nationalism in Modern India, (1999); Borning A., Muller M., Next Steps for Value Sensitive Design, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 1125-1134, (2012); Bornstein D., How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas, (2007); Bowker G., Star S.L., Sorting Things Out, (1999); Chakravartty P., Flexible Citizens and the Internet: The Global Politics of Local High-tech Development in India, Emergences: Journal for the Study of Media & Composite Cultures, 11, 1, pp. 69-88, (2001); Chakravartty P., Sarkar S., Entrepreneurial Justice: The New Spirit of Capitalism in Emergent India, Popular Communication, 11, 1, pp. 58-75, (2013); Chun W.H.K., On Software, or the Persistence of Visual Knowledge, Grey Room, 18, pp. 26-51, (2005); Clinton H.R., Leading through Civilian Power: Redefining American Diplomacy and Development, Foreign Affairs, 8, 6, pp. 13-24, (2010); Coleman E.G., Coding Freedom, (2013); Collins H.M., The TEA Set: Tacit Knowledge and Scientific Networks, Science Studies, 4, 2, pp. 165-185, (1974); Cross J., Dream Zones: Anticipating Capitalism and Development in India, (2014); Cussins C., Ontological Choreography: Agency through Objectification in Infertility Clinics, Social Studies of Science, 26, 3, pp. 575-610, (1996); Dasgupta S., Success, Market, Ethics: Information Technology and the Shifting Politics of Governance and Citizenship in the Indian Silicon Plateau, Cultural Dynamics, 20, 3, pp. 213-244, (2008); Daston L., Galison P., Objectivity, (2007); de la Bellacasa M.P., Matters of Care in Technoscience: Assembling Neglected Things, Social Studies of Science, 41, 1, pp. 85-106, (2011); Deshpande S., Contemporary India: A Sociological View, (2003); Drayton B., Collaborative Entrepreneurship: How Social Entrepreneurs Can Tip the World by Working in Global Teams, Innovations, 6, 2, pp. 35-38, (2011); Edwards P.N., The Army and the Microworld: Computers and the Politics of Gender Identity, Signs, 16, 1, pp. 102-127, (1990); Elyachar J., Markets of Dispossession: NGOs, Economic Development, and the State in Cairo, (2005); Elyachar J., Next Practices: Knowledge, Infrastructure, and Public Goods at the Bottom of the Pyramid, Public Culture, 24, 1-66, pp. 109-129, (2012); Escobar A., Encountering Development: The Making and Unmaking of the Third World, (1995); Fattal A., Facebook: Corporate Hackers, a Billion Users, and the Geo-politics of the “Social Graph.”, Anthropological Quarterly, 85, 3, pp. 927-956, (2012); Ferguson J., The Anti-politics Machine: “Development,” Depoliticization, and Bureaucratic Power in Lesotho, (1994); Fernandes L., Heller P., Hegemonic Aspirations: New Middle Class Politics and India’s Democracy in Comparative Perspective, Critical Asian Studies, 38, 4, pp. 495-522, (2006); Fujimura J.H., The Molecular Biological Bandwagon in Cancer Research: Where Social Worlds Meet, Social Problems, 35, 3, pp. 261-283, (1988); Gupta A.K., From Sink to Source: The Honey Bee Network Documents Indigenous Knowledge and Innovations in India, Innovations, 1, 3, pp. 49-66, (2006); Haraway D., A Manifesto for Cyborgs: Science, Technology, and Socialist-feminism in the 1980s, Socialist Review, 15, 2, pp. 65-108, (1985); Helmreich S., Silicon Second Nature: Culturing Artificial Life in a Digital World, (2000); Irani L., The Cultural Work of Microwork, New Media & Society, (2013); Jackson S.J., Rethinking Repair.

This paper explicates a framework that can be used to analyse how effectively programs are developing active citizenship and activism amongst the participants, especially with a view towards their ongoing participation in civil society. Such a framework will be of use to practitioners seeking to analyse their programs, as well as policy makers interested in developing new programs of civics and citizenship education, or evaluating existing ones. Foregrounding the research in the context of civics and citizenship education in Australia, I illustrate the development of the framework through an activist education program, Justice Citizens, which took place in a Western Sydney high school. Justice Citizens is a useful example to examine the efficacy of the framework; it was a student-centred film voice project that required students to engage with issues in their local community. © 2015, Western Australian Institute for Educational Research Inc.

This article explores the rationale, impact and citizens’ opinion of the mobile phone blackout. It draws on focus group discussions with local opinion leaders and in-depth personal interviews with military and security insiders, as well as data of Boko Haram incidences before, during and after the blackout from military sources and conflict databases. It argues that, although the mobile phone shutdown was ‘successful’ from a military-tactical point of view, it angered citizens and engendered negative opinions toward the state and new emergency policies. While citizens developed various coping and circumventing strategies, Boko Haram evolved from an open network model of insurgency to a closed centralized system, shifting the center of its operations to the Sambisa Forest. This fundamentally changed the dynamics of the conflict. The shutdown demonstrated, among others, that while ICTs serve various desirable purposes for developing states, they will be jettisoned when their use challenges the state’s legitimacy and raison d'être, but not without consequences. © 2015 The Author(s).","Boko Haram; ICTs; Nigeria","","","","","","Adibe J., What do we really know about Boko Haram, Boko Haram: The Anatomy of a Crisis, pp. 9-15, (2013); Amnesty International, Nigeria: More than 1,500 killed in armed conflict in North-Eastern Nigeria in early 2014, (2014); Burt R.S., The social capital of opinion leaders, Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 566, pp. 37-54, (1999); Eich E., Macauley D., Ryan L., Mood dependent memory for events of the personal past, Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, pp. 201-215, (1994); El-Bendary M., The Egyptian Revolution: Between Hope and Despair: Mubarak to Morsi, (2013); Filiu J., The Arab Revolution: Ten Lessons from the Democratic Uprising, (2011); Ghonim W., Revolution 2.0: The Power of the People is Greater Than the People in Power: A Memoir, (2012); Giddens A., A Contemporary Critique of Historical Materialism, (1981); Jacob J.U., Rethinking information intervention in violently divided societies: MONUC's public information operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo, (2010); Jacob J.U., Transforming conflicts with information: Impacts of UN Peace Radio programmes in the Democratic Republic of Congo, War & Society, 33, 4, (2014); Keller E.B., Berry J.L., The influentials: One American in ten tells the other nine how to vote, where to eat, and what to buy, (2003); Knoke D., Networks of political action: Toward theory construction, Social Forces, 68, pp. 1041-1063, (1990); Knoke D., Political networks: The structural perspective, (1990); Mantzikos I., The absence of state in Northern Nigeria: The case of Boko Haram, African Renaissance, 7, 1, pp. 57-62, (2010); Marshall R., Gitsodarmo I., Variation in the characteristics of opinion leaders across cultural borders, Journal of International Consumer Marketing, 8, 1, pp. 5-23, (1995); National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), There are 981,416 IDPs in Nigeria; Nigerian Communication Commission Sim registration; Nisbert E., The engagement model of opinion leadership: Testing validity within a European context, International Journal of Public Opinion Research, 18, 1, pp. 3-30, (2006); Onuoha F., Understanding Boko Haram's attacks On telecommunication infrastructure, Boko Haram: The Anatomy of a Crisis, pp. 16-26, (2013); Premium Times, Boko Haram claims responsibility for telecoms attacks, vows to destroy more schools, (2012); Premium Times, Jonathan ignores Governors, Anglican Church, ACN, CPC, others to declare State of Emergency in Borno, Yobe, Adamawa, (2013); Rogers E.M., Diffusion of Innovations, (2003); Shehu M., Crooks pursue emergency rule extension in N.E, The Politico, 4, 16, (2014); Thompson J., The media and modernity: A social theory of the media, (1995); Vanguard Newspaper, (2012); Weimann G., The influentials: Back to the concept of opinion leaders, Public Opinion Quarterly, 55, pp. 267-279, (1991)","","","Ubiquity Press Ltd","","","","","","21652627","","","","English","Stability","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84946744610"

Excavating the construction of the refugee category reveals how unwarranted assumptions shape contemporary disputes about the scale of refugee crises, appropriate policy responses, and suitable research tools. Empirical studies of how violence interacts with economic and other factors shaping mobility offer lessons for both fields. Adapting existing theories that may not appear immediately applicable, such as household economy approaches, helps explain refugees' decision-making processes. At a macro level, world systems theory sheds light on the interactive policies around refugees across states of origin, mass hosting, asylum, transit, and resettlement. Finally, focusing on the integration of refugees in the Global South reveals a pattern that poses major challenges to theories of assimilation and citizenship developed in settler states of the Global North.

While prior educational research and interventions have emphasized education for employment or citizen development, the authors argue for a broader and more developmental approach to young people’s cognitive, emotional, and behavioral well-being, consistent with the tenets of Islam. This conceptual framework was used to launch empirical research during 2018 in 16 geo-graphical areas, where data analysis is underway to assess four key constructs among high school and university students: empathy, forgiveness, community mindedness, and moral reasoning. This article advocates for a new approach to studying education in predominantly Muslim societies. Ultimately, the research will produce policy recommendations and curriculum adaptations intended to advance education in Muslim societies. The uniqueness of this article stems from its emphasis on the human development approach as a pathway for a transformation that is grounded in localized cultural, religious, and social contexts. © 2019 International Institute of Islamic Thought.","Education reform; Human development; Muslim societies; Transformative education; Values-based education; Wellbeing","","","","","","Abu-Nimer M., Khoury A., Welty E., Unity in diversity: Interfaith dialogue in the Middle East, (2007); Abu-Nimer M., Reconciliation, justice, and coexistence: Theory and practice, (2001); Abu-Nimer M., Nasser I., Forgiveness in the Arab and Islamic contexts: Between theology and practice, Journal of Religious Ethics, 41, 3, pp. 474-494, (2013); Abu-Nimer M., Nasser I., Building peace education in the Islamic educational context, International Review of Education, 63, 2, pp. 153-167, (2017); Adamson F., Astrand B., Darling-Hammond L., Global education reform: How privatization and public investment influence education outcomes, (2016); The meaning of al-qalb and disclosure in al-Qur’an, Journal Ushuluddin, 23, 2, pp. 118-126, (2015); Al Faruqi I., Al Tawhid: Its implications for thought and life, (2000); Alkilany M., The goals of Islamic education, (1997); Aslan R., No god but God: The origins, evolution, and future of Islam, (2011); From a Nation at Risk to a Nation at Hope, (2019); Bandura A., Self-efficacy: Toward a unifying theory of behavioral change, Psychological Review, 84, pp. 191-215, (1977); Bandura A., Social foundations of thought and action: A social cognitive theory, (1986); Bandura A., The explanatory and predictive scope of self-efficacy theory, Journal of Clinical and Social Psychology, 4, pp. 359-373, (1986); Beck D.

In the Netherlands, as in almost all Western countries, Philosophy with Children is linked with the movement for citizenship education. This article reports the research on the practice of Philosophy with Children. Sixteen philosophical inquiries by children in the classroom were recorded, transcribed and analysed. The analyses show that children develop relevant reasoning skills and advanced dialogical skills. The study shows that embedding Philosophy with Children in a democratic practice is necessary for contributing to a critical-democratic citizenship development. The study also shows that Dutch children often give their opinion, but are not often involved in inquiring their own opinions. From a pedagogical point of view, we think that in Dutch culture and in Dutch schools it would be important to stress more a dialogical – community-based – inquiring attitude. © 2015 British Association for International and Comparative Education.","citizenship education; democratic education; Philosophy with Children","","","","","","van den Akker J., Curriculum Perspectives: An Introduction, Curriculum Landscapes and Trends, pp. 1-10, (2003); Anthone R., Verborgen Gedachten[Hidden Thoughts], (2005); Anthone R., Mortier F., Socrates Op De Speelplaats[Socrates in the Playground], (2007); Bartels R., Kinderen Leren Filosoferen, (2007); Bartels R., van Rossum M., Filosoferen Doe Je Zo, (2009); Biesta G.J.J., Good Education in an Age of Measurement: Ethics, Politics, Democracy, (2010); Bouwmeester T., Heesen B., van der Leeuw K., Speelman L., Filosoferen Op De Basisschool, (1994); Bron J., Veugelers W., van Vliet E., Leerplanverkenning Actief Burgerschap, (2009); Cebas E., Garcia-Moriyon F., Research on Philosophy for Children; Cohen L., Manion L., Morrison K., Research Methods in Education, (2007); Cortes P.E., La Dimension Communicationelle de l’Éducation aux Médias: Dialogue et Décentration, (2011); Daniel M.-F., Learning to Philosophize: Positive Impacts and Conditions for Implementation.

Participation fosters ethical citizenship by helping homeowners to acquire democratic skills, increase their awareness of property and political rights, and cultivate a sense of community. The development of ethical citizenship motivates homeowners to redefine legal citizenship. Homeowners have begun to take their rights seriously and actively participate in grassroots elections.

In SOA, terms of service (ToS) and service level agreements (SLAs) were agreed upon on one-to-one basis, as the Web service interfaces were defined. In contrast, API ecosystems appeal for self-serve and instant gratification, being able to access, try and buy an API with a single click. As business teams and citizen developers access API ecosystems, they will want to quickly identify APIs that conform to their legal and usage terms requirements. For example, a large, established enterprise would not be as keen to give up their brand permission easily through use of a 3rd party API, whereas a citizen developer would probably not be concerned too much. Therefore we see a need to be able to automatically assess API terms of service to facilitate comparison and selection of multiple APIs from different providers. To enable API consumers to navigate this flood of APIs, we present a system that simplifies API terms of service creation and assessment. The core of the proposed system is a common API terms of service data model, which captures legal and entitlement capabilities. The system enables profile-based search, thereby allowing users to specify their terms of service requirements relevant to different roles that they may have in the ecosystem (e.g. citizen developer, enterprise procurement officer, etc.). © 2014 IEEE.","API; License; Non-functional matching; Services","Ecosystems; Information services; Quality of service; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Web services; Business to business; Instant gratification; License; Non-functional; Service level agreement (SLAs); Services; Terms of services; Web service interface; Interoperability","","","","","Huang K., Fan Y., Tan W., Li X., Service recommendation in an evolving ecosystem: A link prediction approach, 20th International Conference on Web Services (ICWS 2013), (2013); Gangadharan G.R., Comerio M., Truong H.L., D'Andrea V., De Paoli F., Dustdar S., License-aware service selection, CEC/EEE, pp. 305-310, (2008); Yutu L., Ngu A.H., Zeng L.Z., QoS computation and policing in dynamic web service selection, Proceedings of the 13th International World Wide Web Conference on Alternate Track Papers &Posters.

In the author's opinion, the mechanism of realization of strategic goals should be accompanied by creation of institutions of 'breakthrough' of the Russian Federation into the world economic community and be comprehensive. The necessity of systematic work not only in the economic field, but also in the fields of education, law and politics is shown. Conclusion: the countries that cannot provide the necessary level of education of their citizens, development of science, are doomed, among other things, to deep dependence on the international financial centers and to the role of the source of human resources for the TNCs.","A new model of education; Catching-up modernization; Innovative economy; Stimulus to innovations","","","","","","Andrew J.P., Sirkin L., Return to Innovations: Practical Guide on Managing Innovations in Business/Translated from English.

In this regard, important is the occupational safety and health, establishment of guaranteed minimum wage, providing the state family support, motherhood and childhood, invalids and elderly citizens, development of social services, establishment of state pensions, allowances and other guarantees of social protection. Among the many diverse traits that define the relations and tendencies of development of modern society, there are two features, whose importance cannot be overestimated. The first of these is that the activity of the state takes on in official documents more and more social direction, i.e. in the determination of development priorities increasingly reflected the needs of the person as the Supreme value of society, under which is the state social policy. An essential field of activity of any civilized society is the creation and improvement of extensive and effective social protection system, whose main aim is the comprehensive provision of one-time or ongoing assistance to individual who are in difficult life situation, with the goal of providing the most complete of its realization.

This paper explores the ways in which educators describe how open education is impacting their pedagogical designs. Using a phenomenological approach with self-identifying open education practitioners, we explore how open educational practices (OEP) are being actualised in formal higher education in the context of British Columbia (BC), Canada. The findings suggest that OEP represent an emerging form of learning design, which draws from existing models of constructivist and networked pedagogy, while using the affordances of open tools and content to create and share learning in novel ways. Faculty members report finding ways to use open approaches and technologies to support and enable active learning experiences, present and share learners’ work in real-time, support formative feedback, peer review, and, ultimately, promote community-engaged coursework. By designing learning in this way, faculty members offer learners an opportunity to consider and practise developing themselves as public citizens, develop their knowledge and literacies for working appropriately with copyright and controlling access to their online contributions, while presenting options for extending some of those rights to others. Inviting learners to share their work more widely, demonstrates to them that their work has inherent value beyond the course and can be an opportunity for them to engage directly with their community. © 2019 The Author(s).","Digital literacy; Learning design; Open and networked learning; Open educational practices; Open pedagogy; Technology integrated learning","","","","","","Andrade A., Ehlers U.-D., Caine A., Carneiro R., Conole G., Kairamo A.-K., Koskinen T., Kretschmer T., Moe-Pryce N., Mundin P., Nozes J., Reinhardt R., Richter T., Silva G., Holmberg C., Beyond OER: Shifting Focus to Open Educational Practices.

Developing strong awareness of hazard effects, and giving the tools to citizens, the radiation monitoring become more personalized and self-directed, self-motivated, changing the passive observation into active participation. As reference we used the case of Safecast which was possible due to efforts of tinkering hobbyists, like the members of the Tokyo Hacker space, who designed the way to feed information that was critical onto the Internet in real-time. It emerged from human choreography where science meets the art, and human awareness meets the responsibility. Using donated Geiger counters and connecting them with Arduino development boards, an open source electronics prototyping platform, they were able to do that. Using platforms like Cosmo (formerly Pachube), which connects people to devices, applications and the Internet of Things, it was easy to aggregate all the data in one easily accessible place, which sparked visualizations like Haiyan Zhangs which uses the information available and presents them in easily understandable form, giving meaning to the measurements gathered in Japan. This paper explores the impact of connected objects on future of radiation monitoring. We give brief review and own view how interplay of social situatedness and connectedness, together with movable lab on chips, including signal acquisition and visualization of the world, data collection and aggregation, and presentation in an understandable way, are at the heart of the Internet of Things which dramatically changed the social response and relation to the nuclear disasters. © 2015 RAD Conference Proceedings.","Community lab; DIY scientists; Open source platform; Public awareness; Radiation; Safecast","Data visualization; Disasters; Heat radiation; Internet of things; Nuclear reactors; Personal computing; Signal processing; Visualization; Community lab; DIY scientists; Open source platforms; Public awareness; Safecast; Radiation effects","","","","","Nascimento S., Pereira A.G., Ghezzi A., An annotated account of an on-going movement From Citizen Science to Do It Yourself Science, JRC93942; Austin B., IPhone Versus Soviet Subterfuge Make Fukushima No Chernobyl, Bloomberg Businessweek, (2011); Citizen scientists help monitor radiation in Japan, BBC Programs, (2011); Courtland R., Radiation Monitoring in Japan Goes DIY, IEEE Spectrum Tech Talk, (2011); Abe Y., Analyzing The Fukushima Nuclear Crisis Through Uses of Social Media: A Short Essey on A Work in Progress; Cohn J.P., Citizen science: Can volunteers do real research?, Bioscience, 58, pp. 192-197; Griffitchs A., DIY labs offer an agile alternative to university based research, The Guardian; Nascimento S., Guimara A., Ghezzind P.A., JRC Science and Policy Reports: From Citizen Science to Do It Yourself Science, (2014); Anderson D.P., Christesen C., Allen B., Designing a runtime system for volunteer computing, Proceedings of the 2006 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputers, (2006); Study: Modeling Fukushima NPP Radioactive Contamination Dispersion Utilizing Chino M Et Al Source Terms"".

First, I defend and expand the Fortificationist Theory of Punishment (FTP). Second, I argue that this theory implies that non-consensual neurointerventions – interventions that act directly on one’s brain – are permissible. According to the FTP, punishment is justified as a way of ensuring that citizens who infringe their duty to demonstrate the reliability of their moral powers will thereafter be able to comply with it. I claim that the FTP ought to be expanded to include citizens’ interest in developing their moral powers. Thus, states must ensure that their citizens develop their moral reliability, not only because they must enforce their citizens’ compliance with certain duties, but also because states have the duty to maintain the conditions for stability and satisfy their citizens’ interest in developing their moral powers. According to this account of the FTP, if neurointerventions are the only or best way of ensuring that offenders can discharge their fortificational duties, states have strong reasons to provide these interventions. © 2019, The Author(s).","","","","","","","","A.

Persons with psychosocial disabilities' experiences of various societal domains such as school, work, family life, leisure activities and contact with welfare agencies need a complex analysis which takes into account both personal and contextual factors. This article draws on 15 interviews with informants with psychosocial disabilities and discusses their experiences and the difficulties that they met during their lives. These experiences are conceptualised with the framework of ""active citizenship"" developed by Hvinden et al. (2016), which distinguishes three core dimensions of active citizenship: security, influence and autonomy. The empirically grounded article discusses the opportunities and barriers that encourage or hamper persons with psychosocial disabilities to be active citizens in the Swedish welfare state and underlines some of the main challenges that stand in the way of their ""full and effective participation in society"" (CRPD, article 1). © 2016 Association ALTER.","Active citizenship; CRPD; Life course; Psychosocial disabilities; Sweden; Welfare system","adult; adult education; citizenship; Conference Paper; female; health insurance; high school; human; major clinical study; male; patient autonomy; priority journal; psychosocial disability; psychosocial disorder; social insurance; social security; social work; special education; Sweden; vocational rehabilitation; young adult","","","","","Årsredovisning [Public Employment Services, Annual Report], (2014); Du Gay P., Consumption and Identity at Work, (1996); Devetzi S., Stendahl S., Too Sick to Work?

It presents various acts of claims-making initiated by Eritrean refugees themselves or in response to hostility by others, as well as acts inaugurated by Israeli civil society organisations on behalf of or with refugee populations. Drawing on the concept of activist acts of citizenship developed by Engin Isin, the paper subsequently analyses to what degree those acts have redefined aspects of social and political membership for Eritrean refugees in Israel. In a further step, it shows the limitations of such acts in terms of developing a solidaristic refugee-citizen agenda that profoundly challenges hegemonic public discourse and political debate. The paper concludes by arguing that activist acts of citizenship are best studied in relation to the transformative power they may have on the various individuals engaging in them, but not as a strategy for a wider politics of resistance, as ultimately nation state politics continue to determine the actual realisation of concrete rights. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Acts of citizenship; claims-making; Eritrea; Israel; refugees; resistance","Eritrea; Israel; asylum seeker; citizenship; civil society; hegemony; human rights; political discourse; political power; refugee","","","","","‘Do Not Send Us So We Can Become Refugees Again’: From ‘Nationals of a Hostile State’ to Deportees: South Sudanese in Israel, (2013); World Refugee Day Report, (2011); Arendt H., The Origins of Totalitarianism, (1951); Eritrea: A Nation Silenced, (2012); Booth W., Israeli Government to Refugees: Go back to Africa or Go to Prison, Washington Post, (2015); Brun C., Reterritorilizing the Relationship between People and Place in Refugee Studies, Geografiska Annaler, Series B: Human Geography, 83, 1, pp. 15-25, (2001); Castaneda H., Medical Aid as Protest: Acts of Citizenship for Unauthorized Im/Migrants and Refugees, Citizenship Studies, 17, 2, pp. 227-240, (2013); Chouliaraki L., The Ironic Spectator: Solidarity in the Age of Post-humanitarianism, (2013); Furst-Nichols R., Jacobsen K., African Migration to Israel.

This article returns to Marshall's lecture to show that he was in fact aware of such problems, but nonetheless held the provision of social rights to be a valuable normative project.
