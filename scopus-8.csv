This study draws on open innovation and upper echelons theories to analyze the effects of top management meetings on open innovation instruments, product innovation and sales performance. We use partial least squares structural equation modeling and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to perform the path analysis of the hypothesized effects of top management meetings using data of 1,523 firms across 11 European countries. The results support the hypotheses that declare that top management meetings with suppliers positively influence product innovation while the effects of top management team meetings on product innovation remain negative. Surprisingly, the hypothesis that top management meetings with suppliers positively affect firm sales performance was not confirmed. Additionally, our efforts support the critical role of buyer–supplier relationships for innovation activities, primarily for services rather than manufacturing industries. © 2023 The Authors.

In the face of unanticipated disruptions, being resilient and sustainable has been rewarding for supply chains in terms of competitive advantage. However, literature is still far from possessing an encompassing sustainable supply chain framework (SSCF). As a contribution to the extant literature, the present study expounds a prominent concept termed negative entropy and explores its role in the SSCF. To accomplish this goal, the effect of negative entropy on supply chain sustainability is tested. Following the open systems theory and drawing from the collaboration and information management aspects of the negative entropy, co-creation, open innovation and network governance concepts which are considered to be relevant in this context are selected to be the antecedents of negative entropy. The empirical research is conducted on prominent logistics service providers and firms from various sectors with approved research and development departments in Turkey. The obtained data were subjected to covariance-based structural equation modeling analysis via Lisrel program. According to results, negative entropy is found to be a robust element in explaining supply chain sustainability. Furthermore, whereas co-creation and network governance reflected significant effects on negative entropy, surprisingly, open innovation demonstrated no substantial impact. This paper opens up a new front in sustainable supply chain management studies with a notable empirical study introducing negative entropy in the context of open systems theory. © 2021","Co-creation; Negative entropy; Network governance; Open innovation; Resilience; Supply chain sustainability","Competition; Entropy; Service industry; Supply chain management; Sustainable development; System theory; Competitive advantage; Empirical research; Logistics service provider; Negative entropies; Network governances; Research and development; Structural equation modeling; Sustainable supply chains; Information management","","","","","","","Ageron B., Gunasekaran A., Spalanzani A., Sustainable supply management: an empirical study, Int.

Several authors have found in Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) the basis for more suitable management models that should allow firms to adapt and survive under highly complex, uncertain and changing environments. The incorporation of external capabilities and knowledge through open innovation can increase an organization's adaptability because it amplifies significant differences and increases the number of transforming exchanges, through a higher interaction with external system agents. However, too much difference can generate a large number of possibilities, reducing momentum for action, and too many exchanges limits individual behaviour. Therefore, it is important to be selective so that organizations in pursuit of adaptability through open innovation don't fall into chaos. By using the example of the Engineering and Tooling sector, this paper explores the impact of open innovation on adaptability and the importance of selectivity and knowledge brokers. © 2008 Nottingham University.","Adaptability; Complex adaptive systems; Knowledge brokers; Open innovation; Selectivity","Adaptive systems; Catalyst selectivity; Industrial management; Adaptability; Changing environment; Complex adaptive systems; External systems; Individual behaviour; Knowledge brokers; Management Model; Open innovation; Innovation","","","","","","","Battram A., Navigating complexity, The Essential Guide to Complexity Theory in Business and Management, (1998); Beira E., Crespo C., Gomes N., Menezes M., Dos Moldes À Engenharia de Produto, A Trajectória de Um Cluster, (2004); Bennet A., Bennet D., The Intelligent Complex Adaptive System, (2004); De Sousa M., The sustainable innovation engine, VINE, The Journal of Information and Knowledge Management Systems, 36, 4, (2006); Dooley K., A nominal definition of complex adaptive systems, The Chaos Network, 8, 1, pp. 2-3, (1996); Drucker P., Innovation and Entrepreneurship, (1986); Leonard D., Wellsprings of Knowledge.

Despite the growing attention to the importance of national culture in shaping organizations' innovation activities, there is limited research that has linked national culture with OI to explain the variances in innovation performance. In order to address this gap, a meta-analysis is undertaken based on data from 1,460,700 firms and subfirm units in 111 studies published from 2003 to 2019. This research finds strong evidence that national culture influences the relationship between OI and innovation performance not only in a linear manner as conventionally thought, but also in a curvilinear pattern. Specifically, out of the six Hofstede's national culture dimensions, four influence the OI-performance relationship in a curvilinear manner (individualism, uncertainty avoidance, long-term orientation, and indulgence), and the remaining two have either a liner (power distance) or insignificant (masculinity) impact on the OI-performance relationship. This research challenges the traditional linearity assumption of national culture's impact, enriches current understanding of the complexity and nuances of the OI-performance relationship, and provides practical implications for the effective management of OI projects across national borders. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Hofstede; meta-analysis; national culture; open innovation; performance","Complexity theory; Cultural difference; Hofstede; Linearity; Meta-analysis; National cultures; Open innovation; Performance; Standard organization; Technological innovation; Uncertainty","","","","","","","Bogers M., Et al., The open innovation research landscape: Established perspectives and emerging themes across different levels of analysis, Ind.

To answer this question a sample of 43 cross-sector firms were reviewed for their OI implementation approaches. The study analyzed how firms moved from practising closed to open innovation, classifying the adoption path according to the impetus for the adoption of the OI paradigm and the coordination of the OI implementation. The way firms adopted OI was found to vary according to (1) their innovation requirements, (2) the timing of the implementation and (3) their organizational culture. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Unfortunately, our understanding of how these boundary-spanning collaboration projects work and what needs to be done so as to increase the odds for success is relatively poor. This chapter describes the case of the project IQBID, which brought together professionals from universities and different industrial environments to develop a novel system that significantly increases the comfort and energy efficiency of buildings. Within an action research framework, several challenges that were endangering the advancement of the project were uncovered, such as inexistence of a common business vision. However, the underlying problem was issues of human-related nature in the form of communication incongruities, different expectations, individual interests and lack of trust. The research team developed an intervention that could successfully deal with unspoken issues and lead to a shared business strategy. Thus, by analysing a specific case of convergence, this chapter seeks to contribute to open innovation research by linking the relatively unexplored context of technology convergence with the human aspect of collaboration. © 2017 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

The purpose of this paper is to implement a frame of reference for understanding the start-ups' incubator as a complex system where innovation, learning, and self-organization take place. We build on the interfaces between the Complexity Theory (i.e., complexity sciences) and Open Innovation literature to identify principles, patterns, and conditions that frame the incubation practices as simple rules aimed to sustain the innovation process towards the creation of new ventures. Results from the multiple case studies conducted in five incubators show that the features of variety, nonlinear interaction, interdependence, autonomy, and emergence of the incubation process framed as a complex system are enabled in different ways by the combination of the open innovation practices and services provided by the start-ups' incubators, including the provision of physical infrastructure, access to funding streams, experts/entrepreneurs networking, education/workshops, mentorship, and advice. © 2018 by the authors.","Business incubator; Case study; Complexity sciences; Open innovation; Practices","","","","","","Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (DGIST-18-IT-01)","Direct investment of public dedicated funds Dedicated agreements with banks Taxand legal advice Financial advice: mentorship and meetings with experts to define sources for funding","Albino V., Carbonara N., Giannoccaro I., Innovation in industrial districts: An agent-based simulation model, Int.

Because of the mixed outcomes attainable through SMEs' openness, managers must weigh the beneficial aspects of boundary-spanning against the complexities coming from inter-organizational arrangements and knowledge transfer. Building upon the tenets of dual-process theory, this study highlights the cognitive configurations leading toward willingness or reluctance of OI adoption in SMEs. This is done by investigating perceptions of barriers, benefits, and organisational resistance to openness, such as the not-invented-here (NIH) and not-shared-here (NSH) syndromes in combination with decision-makers’ cognitive styles. To shed further light on observed heterogenous outcomes and the effects of managerial cognitive configurations, this study analyses the willingness and reluctance to adopt OI among 434 managers and entrepreneurs working in SMEs. The results of combined PLS-SEM and fsQCA analyses outline different decisional paths associated with willingness and reluctance to adopt OI. Thus, this research contributes to the ‘human side of OI’ paradigm by providing fruitful implications about cognitive configurations of decision-makers in SMEs concerning OI adoption. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Adoption; Cognition; Decision-making; Human side; Intuition; Open innovation; Rationality; SME","Behavioral research; Decision making; Human resource management; Knowledge management; Adoption; Cognition; Decision makers; Decisions makings; Human side; Innovation adoption; Intuition; Open innovation; Rationality; Small and medium-sized enterprise; Managers","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH","In the context of SMEs, where resource availability is often limited, embracing the somewhat perilous adoption of OI forces firms to commit and allocate resources in the present against benefits deferred to the long term (Bigliardi and Galati, 2016; van de Vrande et al., 2009). Consequently, decision-makers could negatively frame OI, considering it too risky a source of capital expenditure without a short-term benefit (Bigliardi and Galati, 2016; Lee et al., 2019). In fact, decision-makers may assess OI carefully and suspiciously, often leading to non-adoption decisions because of the perceived costs, lack of organisational structure, and lack of proper supporting network (Bogers et al., 2017; Greco et al., 2019). As OI adoption represents a continuum and not a binary state of open–closed (Barrett et al., 2021), the decision to pivot and embrace the OI route lies in the decisions of entrepreneurs, managers, and innovators at the strategic level (Flamini et al., 2021; Kor et al., 2007; Najar and Dhaouadi, 2020). This is particularly true for SMEs, where the decision-making power is often concentrated in one or a small group of individuals, creating a situation where cognitive perceptions and attitudes become central (Najar and Dhaouadi, 2020; Pappas et al., 2021).The research model was firstly assessed using the PLS-SEM method (Hair et al., 2014; Henseler et al., 2016) with SmartPLS software version 3.3.3. PLS-SEM is a composite-based method for structural equation modelling, which is useful for theory testing with a prediction perspective (Rasoolimanesh et al., 2021). PLS-SEM is an ideal procedure for estimating and assessing the hypothesised relationships in path models with latent variables (Hair et al., 2014), as it facilitates the examination of complex path models by supporting the unrestricted use of different variable types and nonlinear terms (Hair et al., 2012, 2014). This approach mainly encompasses two procedures: (1) measurement model assessment, and (2) evaluation of the structural model. Accordingly, PLS-SEM bases its results on a symmetric mean effect of variables, producing a result that explains the existing relations with average effects. However, in recent years, scholars have debated the use of a solely symmetrical approaches, arguing that average effects are not always capable of catching the various facets of a phenomenon (Rasoolimanesh et al., 2021). As a result, to complement the PLS-SEM analysis, an fsQCA approach was implemented (Rasoolimanesh et al., 2021; Yildirim et al., 2022).The quality of the structural model was firstly evaluated using the coefficient of determinations (R2). Moreover, the evaluation analysis revealed minimum collinearity in each set of predictors, as all the variance inflation factor (VIF) values were below the threshold of 5 with an average value (μ) of 1.880 (Hair et al., 2011). To test the model fit, the RMS theta was calculated, which is the root mean squared residual covariance matrix of the outer model residuals (Hair et al., 2011). This analysis computes the degree to which the outer model residuals correlate, and it is particularly useful for studies that assess reflective models. The acceptable cut-off for RMS theta for PLS path models is 0.12 (Henseler et al., 2016). The RMS theta computed here was 0.116, which supports the model fit criterion. In addition, a blindfolding analysis was executed for all endogenous constructs, for which the Q2 values were above zero (NIH = 0.053; NSH = −0.001; PBE = 0.029; PBA = 0.007; WA = 0.385), indicating that the structural model had a satisfactory predictive relevance for the dependent variable.The results presented in Table 4 show that intuitive cognition did not play any direct role in adopting the OI strategy among decision-makers. Further, the analysis revealed a lack of support for the influence of the NIH syndrome on willingness to adopt OI strategies. However, the remaining direct effects were validated, showing that the effect of the NSH syndrome and perception concerns (i.e. perceived benefit and perceived barriers) affected managerial willingness to adopt OI. Also, the results confirmed that rational cognition had a direct effect on the NIH syndrome among decision-makers, while the same was not true about the connection between rational cognition and the NSH syndrome. Regarding perception concerns (i.e. perceived benefits and perceived barriers), rational cognition was positively associated with them. Lastly, rational cognition was not positively associated with willingness to adopt OI, similar to what was predicted for intuitive cognition.Configuration R5 presented the profile of balanced decision-makers, apparently not interested in innovating through OI. The profile showed a decision-making process based on cognitive aspects, both rational and intuitive; thus, a balanced and all-rounded evaluation of OI was made (Adinolfi, 2021). The decision-makers depicted by Configuration R5 also negatively evaluated the benefits of OI (○PBE), and their perception of barriers was central. Thus, barriers and costs related to them offset the benefits of OI. Notably, in this configuration, the low willingness to adopt OI was not affected by preconceptions and biases, as the two syndromes were absent (Ahn et al., 2017; van de Vrande et al., 2009). Therefore, this configuration (R5) showed the profile of a decision-maker that, after careful assessment of OI's implications, came to the decision that OI was not convenient or appropriate for their businesses (Barrett et al., 2021; Bigliardi and Galati, 2016). Indeed, some situations may structurally limit the ability of an SME to reap the benefits of OI. For example, when the product's market size is expected to be large and capable of generating significant benefits for the company, managers tend to avoid the use of OI, as well as when significant R&D funding and grants are available for the company (Lee et al., 2019). The same applies when the cost of formal intellectual property rights mechanisms are too extensive, not allowing SMEs to fully protect their knowledge. In this case, SMEs adopt a defensive tactic, keeping their internally generated knowledge undisclosed (von Briel and Recker, 2017). Finally, maintaining the relation network with OI partners is far from inexpensive, and strained resources can limit the adoption of OI in SMEs due to its interactions and relational costs (von Briel and Recker, 2017).Therefore, our findings create some interesting perspectives for policymaking and education. Perceived barriers can be dismantled by appropriate policy intervention aiming to favour OI adoption and networking, such as clearer regulations and collaboration grants (Barrett et al., 2021; De Marco et al., 2020; Stojčić, 2021). This is true for emerging and transition economies, where innovation network of SMEs play a crucial role in the welfare of counties (Stojčić, 2021).","Adinolfi P., A journey around decision-making: searching for the “big picture” across disciplines, Eur.

The main focus of this paper is to investigate the critical role of complexity in the project level to identifying the compatibility of those external sources involved in NPD. The low technology-intensive sector in Spain were chosen as a target context, there were many innovative SMEs operating in these industries and because these sectors were going through significant changes. Four external knowledge sources, Universities, suppliers, customers and competitors and four open innovation practices, Community, Platform, Partnership and seller-buyer agreement, in the new product development were identified. The study shows that in SMEs, project complexity plays an important role in selecting the external source and implementation of open innovation practices. The main conclusion of the study is that the external collaboration in new product development projects is determined by different dimensions of project complexities and in projects with different type of complexity, the SMEs follow different external knowledge sources and open innovation practices. The study results imply that SMEs benefit from opening up their innovation process in the new product development projects. The firms in this study employed a blend of strategies that is more compatible with dimensions of project complexity. They collaborated actively with different external knowledge source and different modes of collaboration, when they have determination of different dimensions of project complexity. Also, the study extends understanding of the strategic use of open innovation in SMEs by demonstrating how SMEs balance the risk of project complexity built on new product development and the benefit of creating a wider capability base with partnerships. © 2016 Authors.","Collaboration modes; Collaboration strategies; New product development; Open innovation practices; SME","","","","","","","","Aaltonen K., Jaakko K., Tuomas O., Stakeholder salience in global projects, International journal of project management, 26, 5, pp. 509-516, (2008); Atuahene-Gima K., An exploratory analysis of the impact of market orientation on new product performance: a contingency approach, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 12, 4, (1995); Baccarini D., The concept of project complexity-a review, International Journal of.

Particularly striking – and of vital importance to the world – are the pioneering efforts to apply crowdsourcing technology and open innovation to solve social, environmental, and economic sustainability challenges. CrowdRising sets out these challenges as context and then highlights the experiences of leaders and early adopters, identifies implementation guidelines, critical success factors and lessons learned, and finally projects where the field is going in the future. With a strong focus on the applications of crowdsourcing for innovation, engagement, and market intelligence, the book profiles the initiatives of companies, NGOs, and technology providers using crowdsourcing to develop these solutions to global problems. It addresses the key challenges impacting organizations: 1) identifying more sustainable ways to design, distribute, transport, recycle, and repurpose products; and 2) discovering and implementing the systems needed to transform global economic growth, drive human prosperity, and replenish the planet’s resources. © 2020 Lorinda R.

However, such relationships have considerable downsides related to the risk of partners' opportunistic behaviour, and managers need to know how to manage such behaviours if they are to profit from the external resources that OI relationships offer. Drawing on resource dependency theory, this study investigates how firms can manage their OI relationships effectively to deal with their upsides and downsides in terms of resource acquisition and opportunistic behaviour. Furthermore, this study examines an open organisational context in the form of open strategy as well as open structures and processes as contingency factors. The multisource data for the empirical analyses stem from survey data from managers in 181 companies and secondary data from a financial database. The results reveal that an open strategy facilitates the transformation of acquired resources into OI product performance and market success. However, an open strategy also increases the risk of partners' opportunistic behaviour and its effect on OI product performance, contrary to the hypotheses. The results indicate that when firms seek to counter the negative impact of opportunistic behaviour, they should implement open structures and processes. Overall, the findings provide guidance for managers about how to ensure that their OI relationships thrive.  © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.","OI product performance; Open innovation; open organisational context; opportunistic behaviour","","","","","","","","Aiken LS, West SG, Multiple Regression: Testing and Interpreting Interactions, (1991); Albers R, Dolfsma W, Leenders R, Vertical and horizontal cross-Ties: Benefits of cross-hierarchy and cross-unit ties for innovative projects, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 33, 2, pp. 141-153, (2015); Anderson P, Complexity theory and organisation science, Organisation Science, 10, 3, pp. 216-232, (1999); Appleyard MM, Chesbrough HW, The dynamics of open strategy: From adoption to reversion, Long Range Planning, 50, 3, pp. 310-321, (2017); Atuahene-Gima K, Slater SF, Olson EM, The contingent value of responsive and proactive market orientations for new product program performance, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 22, pp. 464-482, (2005); Barge-Gil A, Open strategies and innovation performance, Industry and Innovation, 20, 7, pp. 585-610, (2013); Barney J, Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Barney JB, The emergence of resource-based theory: A personal journey, Journal of Management, 47, 7, pp. 1663-1676, (2021); Baron RM, Kenny DA, The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, 6, pp. 1173-1182, (1986); Barringer BR, Harrison JS, Walking a tightrope: Creating value through interorganisational relationships, Journal of Management, 26, 3, pp. 367-403, (2000); Belderbos R, Faems D, Leten B, Van Looy B, Technological activities and their impact on the financial performance of the firm: Exploitation and exploration within and between firms, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 27, pp. 869-882, (2010); Berchicci L, Towards an open R&D system: Internal R&D investment, external knowledge acquisition and innovative performance, Research Policy, 42, pp. 117-127, (2013); Bianchi M, Croce A, Dell Era C, Di Benedetto CA, Frattini F, Organising for inbound open innovation: How external consultants and a dedicated R&D unit influence product innovation performance, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 33, 4, pp. 492-510, (2016); Bogers M, Zobel A, Afuah A, Almirall E, Brunswicker S, Dahlander L, Frederiksen L, Gawer A, Gruber M, Heafliger S, Hagedoorn J, Hilgers D, Laursen K, Magnusson MG, Majchrzak A, McCarthy IP, Moselein KM, Nambisan S, Piller FT, Radzwikon A, Rossi-Lamastra C, Sims J, Wal ALJ Ter, The open innovation research landscape: Established perspectives and emerging themes across different levels of analysis, Industry and Innovation, 24, 1, pp. 8-40, (2017); Brockman P, Khurana IK, Zhong R, Societal trust and open innovation, Research Policy, 47, 10, (2018); Capaldo A, Network structure and innovation: The leveraging of a dual network as a distinctive relational capability, Strategic Management Journal, 28, pp. 585-608, (2007); Chandler AD, Strategy and Structure in the History of the American Enterprise, (1962); Casas-Arce P, Kittsteiner T, Martinez-Jerez FA, Contracting with opportunistic partners: Theory and application to technology development and innovation, Management Science, 65, 2, pp. 842-858, (2019); Cheng CC, Huizingh EK, When is open innovation beneficial?

Nevertheless, leadership education should begin in the educational stages. This research presents a collaborative model of leadership education for high-potential female undergraduate students carried out at the university level between 2017 and 2020, with 75 students. To be successful at improving student leadership skills, self-esteem, self-confidence, and personal inner transformation, this women’s leadership development program was based on four lines of innova-tion: (a) attracting external stakeholders to develop training jointly; (b) making an open program with multidisciplinary students in social sciences and STEM subjects tailored to the professional environment; (c) measuring the learning with all the participants: trainers, directors, managers, program staff and students, using a 360-degree evaluation; and (d) designing an ongoing research process to incorporate improvements from multiple stakeholder perspectives. A multi-source program assessment was used. The results not only show a positive impact on the students’ acquisition of leadership skills but also, on the increase in self-confidence and ambition. The study provides a pioneering model for women’s leadership education that could be used in other similar programs. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the field remains fragmented, with divergent definitions, methods, and theoretical underpinnings across disciplines. Through bibliometric and multi-level content analysis, we analyze 115 studies to address these tensions and propose a systems-based framework that bridges conceptual and practical divides. We map the intellectual structure and synthesize OSI research's antecedents, processes, relationships, and outcomes. Unlike prior reviews focused on particular OSI initiatives (e.g., Living Labs) or single levels of analysis, our study integrates dispersed knowledge to highlight actionable insights for practitioners and policymakers. Finally, our review establishes a thematic agenda for future research, targeting multi-level investigations into OSI drivers, mechanisms, and impacts. © 2025 The Authors","Bibliometrics; Open innovation; Open social innovation; Social innovation; Systematic literature review","Bibliometric; Collaborative approach; Divergents; Multilevels; Open innovation; Open social innovation; Research agenda; Social innovations; Systematic literature review; innovation; literature review; theoretical study; Social psychology","","","","","Corporación Universitaria Minuto de Dios, UNIMINUTO","Jose Nicolas Pacheco acknowledges the support provided by the Parque Cient\u00EDfico de Innovaci\u00F3n Social under the Open Social Innovation research line at Corporaci\u00F3n Universitaria Minuto de Dios.

We create this model for example of a transitional economy, which is the economy of Ukraine. For a comprehensive statistical analysis of the share of natural and energy resources in individual sectors of the economy, data on intermediate consumer costs from the first quadrant of the Input-Output table (Leontief model) were used for the first time. In this way, the most resource-intensive sectors of the economy and those that require investment in innovative technologies of green business are identified. The following sectors have the highest shares in the consumption of natural and water resources: C – Production; D – Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply; E - Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities. In these sectors, first of all, implementing modern (knowledge-rich) green technologies should take place, which will reduce the consumption of natural and water resources. The proposed model can serve as a justification for the choice of investment directions in the remodeling of other economies in the transition period. © 2023 The Authors","Economic Activity; Economic Complexity; Green Economy; Innovative Remodeling; Leontief model; Open Innovation","","","","","","","","Adedoyin F., Abubakar I., Bekun F.V., Sarkodie S.A., Generation of energy and environmental-economic growth consequences: Is there any difference across transition economies?, Energy Rep., 6, pp. 1418-1427, (2020); (1992); Allal-Cherif O., Costa Climent J., Ulrich Berenguer K.J., Born to be sustainable: How to combine strategic disruption, open innovation, and process digitization to create a sustainable business, J.

The countries considered in this paper are i) Estonia and Slovenia as innovation followers; ii) Slovakia, Hungary, Spain, Czech Republic, Italy, Portugal, Norway, and Croatia as moderate innovators; and iii) Bulgaria, Lithuania and Romania as modest innovators. In the empirical approach, the research hypotheses arise from the literature review and are tested using secondary data collected from the Community Innovation Survey (CIS) 2010. The conceptual model is tested using the logistic regression method, which indicates suitable accuracy and reliability for empirical testing purposes. The evidence reveals that for innovation followers, ambidexterity has a greater influence on the practice of eco-innovation, marketing innovation, and product innovation. For moderate innovators, ambidexterity has a greater influence on the practice of product innovation, process innovation, and eco-innovation. Concerning modest innovators, ambidexterity has a greater influence on the practice of product innovation, process innovation, and eco-innovation. With regard to open innovation, for innovation followers, this has a negative influence on product innovation in medium-high and high-tech companies. For moderate innovators, open innovation has a greater influence in process, organizational, and eco-innovation. In the case of modest innovators, open innovation is more significant for innovation outputs in product, organizational, and marketing innovation. Size is not always positively related to innovation outputs. © 2024 China Science Publishing & Media Ltd","CIS; Cooperation; Open innovation; Organizational ambidexterity; Public innovation policies","","","","","","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (NECE-UIDB/04630/2020, UIDB/04630/2020); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT","Funding text 1: This work was supported by The Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (Grants and NECE-UIDB/04630/2020), which provided financial support for this study.; Funding text 2: This work was supported by The Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (Grants and NECE-UIDB/04630/2020), which provided financial support for this study.

This study contributes to existing knowledge by detecting the conditions for knowledge transfer success between both coopetitive and non-competitive ecosystem partners. The study uses a qualitative approach. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 stakeholders across multi-industry ecosystems to compare the presence of knowledge transfer conditions between competitors and non-competitors. Through fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), configurational recipes of conditions were identified, revealing the distinct configurations required of either coopetitive or non-competitive partnerships in the context of innovation ecosystems. The findings show the need for organizations to tailor knowledge exchange practices to the competitive nature of each relationship. Notable theoretical and practical implications are provided for ecosystem stakeholders that engage in coopetitive partnerships to develop innovations. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Coopetition; Ecosystem; FsQCA; Knowledge transfer; Open innovation","","","","","","Kessler Foundation; Ministry of Knowledge Economy, MKE","This work was supported by the Knowledge Economy Skills Scholarships (KESS) .

Nevertheless, the water sector has been claimed to be less innovative than other sectors. This Special Volume on the dynamics of water innovation is based on the realization that, in general, there is a striking absence of academic studies on the dynamics of water innovation. This SV is therefore designed to lay the foundations for the field of water innovation studies, in an effort to integrate the emerging insights. Together, the contributions in this SV capture the current understanding of the dynamics of water innovation and provide insights into how the water innovation process can be fostered. The purpose of this introductory article is threefold, namely to frame the discussion on water innovation dynamics in order to contextualise the contributions of this SV, to provide systematic guidance for studying water innovation dynamics and to suggest the way forward for water innovation studies. It captures the extent of the field of water innovation studies with a review of the literature of the last three decades and frames water innovations. Based on five decades of innovation research and drawing on three areas (management, strategy and policy), we provide an innovation studies taxonomy that consists of four organising dimensions: type of innovation, stage of innovation, level of analysis and measurement. This taxonomy enables researchers to study the dynamics of water innovation from different combinations of conceptual and thematic angles, drawing on the field of innovation studies in a systematic fashion. Finally, we reflect on the way forward for water innovation studies with suggestions for future research. © 2017 The Authors","Business model innovation; Financing innovation; Frugal innovation; Innovation measurement; Innovation systems; Mission oriented policy; Open innovation; Organisational innovation; Product innovation; Service innovation; Social innovation; Technological innovation; Water; Water innovation","Innovation; Taxonomies; Water; Business model innovation; Financing innovation; Frugal innovations; Innovation measurements; Innovation system; Mission-oriented; Open innovation; Organisational innovations; Product innovation; Service innovation; Social innovations; Technological innovation; Dynamics","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; European Research Council, ERC","The urgent need for water innovations is becoming increasingly clear, acknowledged and responded to with accumulating sources and amounts of funding. Examples in Europe include the Horizon 2020 programme (for research, development and innovation activities), the structural funds, 6 6 LIFE 2014–2020 (the EU's funding instrument for the environment and climate action), as well as grants for individual researchers by the European Research Council to undertake basic research. However, financial investment into the water sector is still far behind that of other sectors, such as the energy sector. 7 7 The water sector has also been reported to be less innovative than other sectors whereby innovation indicators suggest far less research and development (R&D) investment in the water sector 8 8 than other sectors ( Ipektsidis et al., 2016 ). This image needs to be adjusted, given the sectoral patterns of innovation in the sector. The pattern of innovation in the water sector follows the natural path of sectors that are supplier-dominated (i.e. supply of equipment) and trading in bulk ( Pavitt, 1984 ); in fact, its rate of R&D investment and valued added is higher than in other sectors with higher R&D intensity ( Ipektsidis et al., 2016 ).

We open the ‘black box’ of the firm to explore how firms transform big data in order to create value and why firms differ in their abilities to create value from big data. Grounded in detailed evidence from China, the world’s largest digital market, where many firms actively engage in value creation activities from big data, we identify several novel features. We find that it is not the data itself, or individual data scientists, that generate value creation opportunities. Rather, value creation occurs through the process of data management, where managers are able to democratize, contextualize, experiment and execute data insights in a timely manner. We add richness to current theory by developing a conceptual framework of value creation from big data. We also identify avenues for future research and implications for practicing managers. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","big data; China; knowledge-based view; open innovation; resource management","","","","","","","","Adner R., Helfat C.E., Corporate effects and dynamic managerial capabilities, Strategic Management Journal, 24, 10, pp. 1011-1025, (2003); Amit R., Schoemaker P., Strategic assets and organizational rent, Strategic Management Journal, 14, 1, pp. 33-46, (1993); Baker T., Nelson R.E., Creating something from nothing: Resource construction through entrepreneurial bricolage, Administrative Science Quarterly, 50, pp. 329-366, (2005); Baldwin C.Y., Von Hippel E., Modelling a paradigm shift: From producer innovation to user and open collaborative innovation, Organization Science, 22, 6, pp. 1399-1417, (2011); Barney J.B., Strategic factor markets: Expectations, luck, and business strategy, Management Science, 32, 10, pp. 1231-1241, (1986); Barney J.B., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Barney J.B., Resource-based theories of competitive advantage: A ten-year retrospective on the resource-based view, Journal of Management, 27, 6, pp. 643-650, (2001); Barney J.B., Arikan A.M., The resource-based view: Origins and implications, Handbook of Strategic Management, pp. 124-188, (2001); Bharadwaj A.S., El Sawy M.A., Pavlou P.A., Et al., Digital business strategy: Toward a next generation of insights, MIS Quarterly, 37, 2, pp. 471-482, (2013); Bingham C.B., Eisenhardt K.M., Furr N.R., What makes a process a capability?

The present paper empirically analyzes the role played by different types of R&D collaborations in the persistence of SME innovative performance. We used a longitudinal database to identify all the Swedish SMEs that launched significant product innovations in the ICT market in the 1990–2019 period, in combination with collected data on the R&D collaborations established by these SMEs. Through several dynamic panel data regression models, we point out how SME innovative performance is significantly affected by R&D collaborations with large firms and universities. Crucially, we show how the impact of these collaborations differs depending on the nature of these relationships.

A systematic literature review (SLR) was carried out encompassing the research topic concerning the relationship between the incubation structures and the performance of technology-based ventures. This comprehensive SLR encompasses a total of 1614 publications, aiming to advance the knowledge on BI and BA. This SLR allowed for the identification of current trends and future challenges, as well as of the most important authors, publications, and journals in this research framework. This SLR establishes a new taxonomy for BI and BA, based upon three main pillars: human capital, social capital, and organizational capital. BI and BA help in the development of new high-technology ventures, by being facilitators for open innovation practices. This SLR is limited by the literature, as the collection of publications was performed exclusively through ISI Web of Science (WoS). Further research can be made into the modes of how these structures impact open innovation practices at the regional level using a knowledge spillover approach. © 2022 by the authors.

In order to achieve the purpose of research, hypotheses were set up by dividing exploitative knowledge sources and exploitative knowledge. Based on the Tobit regression analysis results by using the 975 data of Science and Technology Policy Institute, this research provides four findings as follows: First, exploitative knowledge breadth positively and significantly influences innovation ambidexterity. Second, exploitative knowledge depth positively and significantly influences innovation ambidexterity. Third, explorative knowledge breadth positively and significantly influences innovation ambidexterity. Lastly, the relationship between explorative knowledge significantly influences innovation ambidexterity. The results indicate that their knowledge search strategies ware significant driver of their innovation ambidexterity. In the final conclusion section implications and limitations of research results and suggestion for future research are discussed. © 2022 SAGE Publications.","exploitative knowledge; exploitative knowledge; external knowledge search; innovation ambidexterity; Open innovation","innovation; knowledge; policy implementation; small and medium-sized enterprise; strategic approach; technological development; technology policy","","","","","2020 Yeungnam University","This work was supported by the 2020 Yeungnam University Research Grant.

This study aims to explore the complex relation-ships between SMPs’ usage and organizational performance with respect to small and medium-sized restaurants in Jordan. In addition, it investigates the impact of competition intensity as a moderating variable. The model of the study was assessed and examined by gathering data from 331 Jordanian restaurants using the partial least squares (PLS) method. The findings revealed that SMPs’ usage is positively associated with restaurant performance (financial, marketing, and operational). In addition, the results indicate a significant moderating impact of competition intensity only on the relationship between SMPs’ usage and restaurants’ marketing performance. Based on the results, several theoretical and practical implications for restaurants have been suggested, as well as further research avenues. © 2022 by the authors.

This paper aims to explore if entrepreneurial knowledge combined with the attitude to innovate can overcome the key “imperfections” of the innovation process generated by dynamic, current technological progress in the knowledge-intensive sector. The “imperfections” identified in risk management, asymmetric information in the knowledge management process and hold-up problems can all disrupt collaborative partnerships and limit opportunities for innovation. Design/methodology/approach: A theory-building approach is applied which offers a case study analysis of two small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). These two SMEs operate in Europe but in two different territories: the UK and Italy. The study explores three key imperfections, risk management, asymmetric information in the knowledge management process and hold-up problems, which occur in the innovation process. Findings: The entrepreneurs face these imperfections by adopting an open innovation model. Notwithstanding, both entrepreneurs had to deal with all “imperfections”, and their skills, attributes, attitude and aptitude allowed them to grow their business and continually develop new products. Therefore, the imperfections do not limit the innovative capacity of an entrepreneur but rather enhance their challengeable attitude. In this regard, the case studies induce a further analysis on entrepreneurial knowledge intertwined with entrepreneurial risk management and networking skills. Research limitations/implications: The empirical significance of the two cases does not allow theorisation. However, this research offers interesting results which can be strengthened by a comparative case study with other countries or deeper investigation by applying a quantitative approach. Originality/value: By leveraging entrepreneurial knowledge, the imperfections noted in the innovation process can be overcome. Entrepreneurial knowledge is recognised as the main asset of an enterprise if it is combined with external talent or human resources. Entrepreneurs aim to develop innovative approaches and ideas through establishing both formal and informal collaborative partnership relationships which are used thanks to the entrepreneurs’ networking skills, knowledge and abilities. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Entrepreneurial innovation attitude; Entrepreneurial knowledge; Entrepreneurial risk management; Hold up problems; Knowledge intensive","","","","","","","","Alchian A.A., Klein B., Crawford R.G., Vertical integration, appropriable rents, and the competitive contracting process, Journal of Law and Economics, 21, 2, pp. 297-326, (1978); Alvesson M., Management of Knowledge-Intensive Companies, (1995); Anderson P., Complexity theory and organization science, Organization Science, 10, 3, pp. 216-232, (1999); Audretsch D.B., Lehmann E.E., Plummer L.A., Agency and governance in strategic entrepreneurship, Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 33, 1, pp. 149-166, (2009); Bachtler J., Clement K., Inward investment in the UK and the single European market, Regional Studies, 24, pp. 173-184, (1991); Baumol W., Formal entrepreneurship theory in economics: existence and bond, Journal of Business Venturing, 8, 3, pp. 197-210, (1993); Beggs A., The licensing of patents under asymmetric information, International Journal of Industrial Organization, 10, 2, pp. 171-191, (1992); Borgelt K., Falk I., The leadership/management conundrum: innovation or risk management?, Leadership & Organization Development Journal, 28, 2, pp. 122-136, (2007); Bowers J., Khorakian A., Integrating risk management in the innovation project, European Journal of Innovation Management, 17, 1, pp. 25-40, (2014); Brislin R.W., Back-translation for cross-cultural research, Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 1, 3, pp. 185-216, (1970); Broccardo L., Giacosa E., Culasso F., Ferraris A., Management control in Italian SMEs, Global Business and Economics Review, 19, 5, pp. 632-647, (2017); Burns A.T., Acar W., Datta P., A qualitative exploration of entrepreneurial knowledge transfers, Journal of Knowledge Management, 15, 2, pp. 270-298, (2011); Checkland P., Scholes J., Checkland P., Soft Systems Methodology in Action, 7, (1990); Chrisman J.J., The influence of outsider–generated knowledge resources on venture creation, Journal of Small Business Management, 37, 4, pp. 42-58, (1999); Coase R.H., The nature of the firm, Economica, New Series, 4, 16, pp. 386-405, (1937); Das T.K., Teng B., The risk-based view of trust: a conceptual framework, Journal of Business and Psychology, 19, 1, pp. 85-116, (2004); De Boer M., Van Den Bosch F.A., Volberda H.W., Managing organizational knowledge integration in the emerging multimedia complex, Journal of Management Studies, 36, 3, pp. 379-398, (1999); Del Giudice M., Maggioni V., Managerial practices and operative directions of knowledge management within inter-firm networks: a global view, Journal of Knowledge Management, 18, 5, pp. 841-846, (2014); Del Giudice M., Arslan A., Scuotto V., Caputo F., Influences of cognitive dimensions on the collaborative entry mode choice of small and medium-sized enterprises, International Marketing Review, 34, 5, pp. 652-673, (2017); Del Giudice M., Khan Z., De Silva M., Scuotto V., Caputo F., Carayannis E., The microlevel actions undertaken by owner-managers in improving the sustainability practices of cultural and creative small and medium enterprises: a United Kingdom–Italy comparison, Journal of Organizational Behavior, 38, 9, pp. 1396-1414, (2017); Doherty M.A., Explaining international retailers’ market entry mode strategy: internalization theory, agency theory and the importance of information asymmetry, International Review of Retail, Distribution and Consumer Research, 9, 4, pp. 379-402, (1999); Egbu C., Hayles C., Anumba A., Ruikar K., Quintas P., Getting started in knowledge management: concise guidance for construction consultants and contractors, Partners in Innovation Project (CI 39/3/709), (2004); Eisenschitz A., Gough J., The Politics of Local Economic Policy: The Problems and Possibilities of Local Initiative, (1993); Ferraris A., Santoro G., Dezi L., How MNC’s subsidiaries may improve their innovative performance?

In this study, we aim to address the central premise of how knowledge-sharing networks in meta-organizations can serve as important sources for emerging-market small and medium-sized enterprises (ESMEs) to implement open innovation. To achieve this, we have developed a unique research framework that combines theoretical and empirical approaches. Our framework allows us to precisely understand how SMEs in emerging markets can benefit from both the breadth and depth of external knowledge search through these networks. In particular, we examine whether the breadth and depth of an external knowledge search improves the product and process innovation performance. Moreover, we verify how those innovative performances invigorate eco-innovation, which can be an engine for environmental sustainability, within meta-organization. Based on a sample of 185 SMEs in South Korea, our empirical results demonstrate that the breadth and depth of an external knowledge search positively affects product and process innovation, respectively. In addition, we find that ESMEs’ product innovation contributes positively to eco-innovation achievement, whereas ESMEs’ process innovation contributes insignificantly to their eco-innovation in a meta-organization. We make significant contributions to the literature by examining the roles of ESMEs’ open innovation strategies in a meta-organization, as well as their product and process innovation in explaining eco-innovation. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","Eco-innovation; Emerging market SMEs; Knowledge search; Meta-organization; Process innovation; Product innovation","","","","","","Korean Innovation Survey; Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, HUFS; Sookmyung Women's University; Science and Technology Policy Institute, STEPI","Funding text 1: This work was supported by Sookmyung Women’s University Research Grants.

The implementation of modern information technology in business has become a core need of the hour. This study endeavours to answer how to cope with resistance to change when implementing new technology in the banking sector. A theoretical model has been developed with the blend of ADKAR change model, Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and Hofstede dimensions of national culture to investigate the impact of the ADKAR change model on Technology Acceptance under the moderation of two national culture’s dimensions. Materials and Methods: In order to collect data, 500 self-administered questionnaires were dropped personally in five major banks of five cities of Pakistan using the convenience-based employee intercept sampling technique. The validated response rate was 68% by having 340 fit questionnaires for analysis using covariance-based structure equation modelling with the help of SmartPLS. Results: The results uncover the significant existence of covariance between dimensions of the ADKAR change model and technology acceptance model. The findings are statistically significant, inferring the influential role of change management on technology adoption. Conclusion: The study results provide promising implications based on these conclusions and findings for both theoretical aspects of these different models and practitioners. © Wyższa Szkoła Logistyki, Poznań, Polska.","ADKAR Change Model; Inbound and Outbound Open Innovation; Perceived Ease of Use; Perceived Usefulness; Reinforcement, Uncertainty Avoidance","","","","","","","","Alhirz H., Sajeev A.S.M., Do cultural dimensions differentiate ERP acceptance?

Design/methodology/approach: The authors examine existing knowledge on ILCs and PLCs to highlight the differences and similarities and develop a framework with implications for learning and innovation in digital manufacturing industries. Findings: The authors identify and associate one dominant type of learning with each phase of the ILC: learning-by-participating in the introduction phase, learning-by-feedback in the growth phase, vicarious learning in the maturity phase and learning-by-memory in the decline phase. The study also provides insight into how different types of learning influence PLC in digital innovation. From this perspective, learning-by-feedback is crucial to co-creation, co-production and open innovation. Similarly, learning-by-doing and learning-by-memory are essential to production and usage stages, respectively. Research limitations/implications: The conceptual development in this paper follows a somewhat critical but ultimately elucidative analysis that highlights important research avenues in the interplay of PLC/ILC, organizational learning and digital innovation. Originality/value: This paper clarifies a perennial theoretical problem by differentiating two concepts often conflated in the literature. More importantly, it contributes to the knowledge management literature by shedding light on the connection of ILC and PLC theories to different types of organizational learning. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Digital innovation; Industry lifecycle; Organizational learning; Product lifecycle","","","","","","Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia; Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, MCIU; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (22209, LISBOA-01–0145- FEDER007722, UID/ECO/00124/2013); Agencia Estatal de Investigación, AEI, (PGC2018-101022-A-100)","The authors thank three anonymous reviewers for their valuable suggestions.

The focus is on decisions made in R&D-active small and medium-sized enterprises in terms of absorptive capacity, open innovation, type of R&D, and the organizational structuring of R&D. Based on a representative set of R&D-active firms in Belgium, qualitative comparative analysis reveals that the outcomes in terms of financial performance related to optimal configurations of strategic R&D decisions depend on the firm's size and on the time-lag under consideration. Managers in small-sized firms are advised to pay particular attention to a more functionally-structured R&D approach in configurations of strategic R&D decisions. To increase medium-term financial performance, managers in medium-sized firms benefit from more engagement in research-oriented activities, more in-house innovation, and the enhancement of absorptive capacity in sets of strategic R&D decisions. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Financial performance; Firm size; R&D management; Strategic decision","","","","","","","","Ahuja G., Lampert C.M., Entrepreneurship in the large corporation: A longitudinal study of how established firms create breakthrough inventions, Strategic Management Journal, 22, pp. 521-543, (2001); Alegre I., Mas-Machuca M., Berbegal-Mirabent J., Antecedents of employee job satisfaction: Do they matter?, Journal of Business Research, 69, pp. 1390-1395, (2016); Audia P.G., Greve H.R., Less likely to fail: Low performance, firm size, and factory expansion in the shipbuilding industry, Management Science, 52, pp. 83-94, (2006); Bacidore J.M., Boquist J.A., Milbourn T.T., Thakor A.V., The search for the best financial performance measure, Financial Analysts Journal, 53, pp. 11-20, (1997); Bayus B.L., Erickson G., Jacobson R., The financial rewards of new product introductions in the personal computer industry, Management Science, 49, pp. 197-210, (2003); Bedford D.S., Sandelin M., Investigating management control configurations using qualitative comparative analysis: An overview and guidelines for application, Journal of Management Control, 26, pp. 5-26, (2015); Belderbos R., Carree M., Diederen B., Lokshin B., Veugelers R., Heterogeneity in R&D cooperation strategies, International Journal of Industrial Organization, 22, pp. 1237-1263, (2004); Belderbos R., Faems D., Leten B., VanLooy B., Technological activities and their impact on the financial performance of the firm: Exploitation and exploration within and between firms, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 27, pp. 869-882, (2010); Canibano L., Garcia-Ayuso M., Sanchez P., Accounting for intangibles: A literature review, Journal of Accounting Literature, 19, pp. 102-130, (2000); Chesbrough H., Open innovation: The new imperative for creating and profiting from technology, (2003); Chesbrough H., Vanhaverbeke W., West J., Open innovation: Researching a new paradigm, (2006); Cohen W.M., Levinthal D.A., Absorptive capacity: A new perspective on learning and innovation, Administrative Science Quarterly, 35, pp. 128-152, (1990); Daghfous A., Absorptive capacity and the implementation of knowledge-intensive best practices, S.A.M.

But literature still lacks ""actionable knowledge"" on management of emergent processes. Therefore, the authors seek to propose an empirical analysis with the aim of finding the organizational design drivers that enable self-organization. As creativity could be understood as an important precondition for both adaptation and innovation in an age of complexity, the authors focus on creativity emergence process. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis is based on a framework of self-organization principles. The authors derived it from the literature and used it to empirically analyse open innovation web-based platforms for creativity. They are deemed particularly important because their open and collaborative innovation process is often self-organized and their collaboration relationships seem to be loosely coupled. Therefore, they are a good ground to investigate the alternatives to managerial hierarchy and the knowledge-based organizations associated with emergence and self-organization. Findings: The results highlight important organizational design choices to enable self-organization process: organic structure composed by activity systems to enable reconfiguration; roles enlargement and enrichment and cognitive diversity to enable redundancy; collaboration and participatory decision-making and social capital and networking to enable interconnection; values adaptation, motivations and rules to enable sharing principle. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the empirical knowledge on emergence process, translating the principles of self-organization in managerial actions. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Collaboration; Collective innovation; Complexity; Complexity theory; Creativity; Emergence; Innovation; Open innovation web-based platforms","","","","","","","","Ackoff R.L., The circular organization: An update, Academy of Management, 3, 1, pp. 11-16, (1989); Andrew A.M., Self-Organizing Systems, (1989); Antikainen M., Vaataja H., Rewarding in open innovation communities - how to motivate members?, International Journal of Entrepreneurship and Innovation Management, 11, 4, pp. 440-456, (2010); Axelrod R., Cohen M.D., Harnessing Complexity Organizational Implications of a Scientific Frontier, (1999); Barnard C.I., The Functions of the Executive, (1938); Battistella C., de Toni A.F., A technology foresight methodology: A proposal and a test on field study, Technological Forecasting & Social Change, 78, 6, pp. 1029-1048, (2011); Battistella C., Nonino F., Exploring the impact of motivations on the attraction of innovation roles in open innovation web-based platforms, Production Planning and Control, (2012); Benbya H., McKelvey B., Toward a complexity theory of information systems development, Information Technology & People, 19, 1, pp. 12-34, (2006); Biotto G., Battistella C., de Toni A.F., From design driven innovation to meaning strategy, Management Decision, (2012); Boisot M., MacMillan I., Seok Han K., Explorations in Information Space: Knowledge, Agents, and Organizations, (2007); Brown S.L., Eisenhardt K.M., Competing on the Edge: Strategy As Structured Chaos, (1998); Checkland P., Systems Thinking Systems Practice, (1981); Chesbrough H., Open Innovation: The New Imperative for Creating and Profiting From Technology, (2003); Cowan R., Network structure and the diffusion of knowledge, Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, 28, 8, pp. 1557-1575, (2004); Davidow W.H., Malone M.S., The Virtual Corporation: Structuring and Revitalizing The Corporation For The 21st Century, (1992); Davis S., Meyer C., It's Alive!

Our methodology synthesizes an extensive literature review to identify and explicate four configurations of intellectual property and innovation strategies: open/formal, open/informal, closed/formal, and closed/informal. These configurations reflect the multifaceted decision-making firms face in aligning their innovation models with suitable IP mechanisms. By integrating factors such as industry sector, innovation nature, market dynamics, and legal context, we offer a comprehensive framework that captures the strategic considerations of intellectual property management, highlighting the importance of various factors in shaping firms' protection and innovation decisions. Our findings propose a nuanced understanding of IP strategy selection, setting the stage for future empirical investigations to test and refine this framework across diverse industries and markets. © 2024 The Authors","Closed innovation; Configurational framework; Formal and informal protection mechanisms; Intellectual property strategy; Open innovation","Closed innovations; Complex relationships; Configurational framework; Formal and informal protection mechanism; Innovation models; Intellectual property protection; Intellectual property strategies; Mechanism modeling; Open innovation; Protection mechanisms","","","","","","","Alcacer J., Chung W., Location strategies and knowledge spillovers, Manag.

In related business management literature, shifts from 'closed' to 'open' models are argued to be triggered by new technological, economic and social trends so that many organisations (at least partially) virtualise, their members being distributed across different locations and embedded in various socio-economic and cultural contexts. Complementing that line of argument, the current paper undertakes socio-systems-theoretical revisits to key institutional premises assumed in concepts above - organisation, knowledge, collaboration, complexity etc. - to examine, explore and restate in which sense 'openness' may be feasible in organisational realm and with what respects 'open innovation' may be supported, accordingly. It is argued that, rather than requiring to tear down organisational walls 'outwards' (which in principle is not possible), 'open innovation' enables, and is enabled by, differentiating organisations 'inwards' to better turn 'irritations' feared into chances recognised to leverage upon. © 2008 Nottingham University.","absorptive capacity; co-innovation; knowledge creation; Open innovation; organisational change; social systems","Industrial management; Societies and institutions; Absorptive capacity; Co-innovation; Knowledge creations; Open innovation; Organisational change; Social systems; Innovation","","","","","","","Brown S.L., Eisenhardt K.M., Product development.

One important factor in the process of building an enterprise that is often overlooked is that a business's success is inevitably entwined with the performance of its surrounding ecosystem. Spanning a tapestry of firms, institutions, and individuals, this ecosystem forms the linchpin of success. However, the journey to prosperity demands more than the mere existence of a thriving ecosystem; it necessitates adept management and cultivation of relationships within it. Ecosystem Dynamics and Strategies for Startups Scalability uncovers the nuances of connecting complementary participants, navigating uncertainty among diverse partners, and securing a substantial share of the created value. As a testament to its academic rigor, the book discerns that fostering an ecosystem often hinges upon a ""lead firm"" orchestrating key value-contributing elements, or that the government enacting conducive policies. Beyond the realms of conventional ""open innovation,"" lies the blueprint for a novel economic organization. This organization transcends archaic notions of industries, markets, and hierarchies, ushering in a new era of strategic collaboration. As markets evolve and demands shift, the need for dynamic ecosystems becomes glaringly apparent. The very essence of an ecosystem lies in its ability to evolve and self-renew incessantly. Additionally, effective resource management emerges as an imperative within this intricate tapestry. Resources, the bedrock of any business, demand astute handling to maximize efficiency and profitability. This book outlines how startups, the burgeoning engines of modern economies, can harness intelligent resource management and ecosystem development to ensure scalability and sustainability. The book extends far into diverse facets of resource management, ecosystem construction, and startup scalability, all rooted in comprehensive theoretical analysis. Bridging theory and practice, it furnishes case studies and best practices to accentuate these concepts. As economies worldwide reset post-pandemic, the book assumes greater relevance, illuminating the path for startups to thrive in emerging markets. Scholars, postgraduates, practitioners, and policymakers alike stand to gain a wealth of knowledge, from the evolution of resource management and ecosystems to their pivotal roles in startup success. © 2024 by IGI Global.

In this work, we proposed a dual process model to explore the effects of AI capability on digital product innovation and tested it using quantitative and qualitative methods. In quantitative analysis, based on AI-Open Innovation matrix and dynamic capability theory, we tested the model using a total of 314 managers from 127 firms in the Chinese mainland. We found that AI capability enables digital product innovation by enhancing online value co-creation (a process of external asset) and digital resilience (a process of internal asset). Moreover, socio-cognitive sensemaking strengthens the mediation process of digital resilience but has no significant moderating effect on the mediation process of online value co-creation. The qualitative analysis enables us to better interpret the reasons why sensemaking plays different roles in mediation processes and suggests that it strengthens the effects of online value co-creation and digital resilience on digital product innovation through the external loop (time effect) and the internal loop (interactive effect), respectively. Our findings provide insights into how firms can scale digital product innovation using AI, with important implications for management.  © 2025 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.","AI capability; digital product innovation; digital resilience; online value co-creation; socio-cognitive sensemaking","","","","","","","","Aarikka-Stenroos L, Jaakkola E, Value co-creation in knowledge intensive business services: A dyadic perspective on the joint problem solving process, Industrial Marketing Management, 41, 1, pp. 15-26, (2012); Abou-Foul M, Ruiz-Alba JL, Lopez-Tenorio PJ, The impact of artificial intelligence capabilities on servitization: The moderating role of absorptive capacity-A dynamic capabilities perspective, Journal of Business Research, 157, (2023); Akgun AE, Keskin H, Organisational resilience capacity and firm product innovativeness and performance, International Journal of Production Research, 52, 23, pp. 6918-6937, (2014); Akter S, Wamba SF, Mariani M, Hani U, How to build an AI climate-driven service analytics capability for innovation and performance in industrial markets?, Industrial Marketing Management, 97, pp. 258-273, (2021); Akter S, Hossain MA, Sajib S, Sultana S, Rahman M, Vrontis D, McCarthy G, A framework for AI-powered service innovation capability: Review and agenda for future research, Technovation, 125, (2023); Augier M, Teece DJ, Dynamic capabilities and the role of managers in business strategy and economic performance, Organization Science, 20, 2, pp. 410-421, (2009); Babina T, Fedyk A, He A, Hodson J, Artificial intelligence, firm growth, and product innovation, Journal of Financial Economics, 151, (2023); Baki Kocaballi A, Ijaz K, Laranjo L, Quiroz JC, Rezazadegan D, Tong HL, Willcock S, Berkovsky S, Coiera E, Envisioning an artificial intelligence documentation assistant for future primary care consultations: A co-design study with general practitioners, Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, 27, 11, pp. 1695-1704, (2020); Bardhan I, Karahanna E, Chen H, Connecting systems, data, and people: A multidisciplinary research roadmap for chronic disease management, MIS Quarterly, 44, 1, pp. 185-200, (2020); Barney J, Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Benitez J, Castillo A, Llorens J, Braojos J, IT-enabled knowledge ambidexterity and innovation performance in small US firms: The moderator role of social media capability, Information & Management, 55, 1, pp. 131-143, (2018); Bettiol M, Capestro M, Di Maria E, Micelli S, Overcoming pandemic challenges through product innovation: The role of digital technologies and servitization, European Management Journal, 40, 5, pp. 707-717, (2022); Beverland MB, Micheli P, Farrelly FJ, Resourceful sensemaking: Overcoming barriers between marketing and design in NPD, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 33, 5, pp. 628-648, (2016); Biswas S, De S, Subalova M, Ghosh A, A process model of leveraging survival crisis towards building innovation as core competence: Theorization from the journey of a textile firm, South Asian Journal of Business and Management Cases, 10, 3, pp. 243-259, (2021); Blichfeldt H, Faullant R, Performance effects of digital technology adoption and product & service innovation: A process-industry perspective, Technovation, (2021); Bogers M, Chesbrough H, Heaton S, Teece DJ, Strategic management of open innovation: A dynamic capabilities perspective, California Management Review, 62, 1, pp. 77-94, (2019); Boudreau KJ, Let a thousand flowers bloom?

Since humanitarian problems are complex problems, with the relevant knowledge being hidden, organizational search theory advocates the application of bottom-up and theory-guided search processes to identify the social innovations that solve these. Unfortunately, there has been no theoretical attention to understanding which approaches apply in this context. Further, established theory-guided bottom-up search processes, such as the lead user method, are unsuitable to the humanitarian sector, and we lack practice examples of adequate search processes. To start addressing this gap in theory and practice, procedural action research was done with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to develop a theory-guided bottom-up innovation search process for the real-life humanitarian problem of recurring floods in Indonesia. It revealed that an innovation search process for this context must differ significantly concerning its objectives and the steps to be taken from the lead user method, which was used as a starting point. Further, a comparison of the technical quality and the social impacts of the identified social innovations with social innovations identified through a non-theory-guided bottom-up search process (i.e., an innovation contest) suggests the superiority of this theory-guided search process. With this conclusion and the insights derived throughout the development of the search process, this study makes important contributions to theory development in the social and open innovation literatures and delivers important recommendations for social innovation practice in the humanitarian sector. © 2019 The Authors.

This study examines four factors of collaborative innovation network that affect the level of knowledge transfer performance of firms, viz., network size, network heterogeneity, network tie-strength, and network centrality. Based on a survey to high-tech firms in China, this study uses fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) to explore the relationships between collaborative innovation network and knowledge transfer performance. This study supports the argument that different causal paths explain knowledge transfer performance of firms. The findings reveal that the presence of network size, network tie-strength, and network centrality determines the level of knowledge transfer performance. However, network heterogeneity does not show significant impact on the knowledge transfer performance. The findings also identify theoretical and practical implications of collaborative innovation network and knowledge transfer research. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Collaborative innovation network; Fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA); Knowledge transfer performance","","","","","","Shanghai Municipal Education Commission, (13SG41); Shanghai Planning Fund of Philosophy and Social Sciences, (2014BGL011); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71472118)","The authors also thank Kun-Huang Huarng, Feng Chia University, and Domingo E.

The success of an A&D strategy depends on the embeddedness of the firm in the network of organizations comprised of an open innovation system and supported by an inter-organizational process of innovation. The embeddedness of Cisco Systems in the ambidextrous high-tech cluster of the Silicon Valley, especially its ties to venture capital firms and start-ups, explains the success of its A&D strategy. The spreading of A&D strategy among large firms reinforces the dynamics of the open innovation system and nurtures the cluster's ambidexterity by increasing incentives for other organizations and individuals of the network to explore new knowledge and create fresh start-ups. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","A&D; Ambidexterity; High-tech cluster; Open innovation; Silicon Valley; Venture capital firms","","","","","","","","Ahuja G., Katila R., Technological acquisitions and the innovation performance of acquiring firms: A longitudinal study, Strategic Management Journal, 22, pp. 197-220, (2001); Andriopoulos C., Lewis M., Exploitation-exploration tensions and organizational ambidexterity: Managing paradoxes of innovation, Organization Science, 20, 4, pp. 696-717, (2009); Becattini G., Industrial sectors and industrial districts: Tools for industrial analysis, European Planning Studies, 10, 4, pp. 483-493, (2002); Benner M., Tushman M., Exploitation, exploration, and process management: The productivity dilemma revisited, Academy of Management Review, 28, pp. 238-256, (2003); Brown S., Eisenhardt K., The art of continuous change: Linking complexity theory and time-paced evolution in relentlessly shifting organizations, Administrative Science Quarterly, 42, 1, pp. 1-34, (1997); Burgelman R., Christensen C., Wheelwright S., (2004); Burke R., (1992); Byers T., Dorf R., (2005); Capron L., The long-term performance of horizontal acquisitions, Strategic Management Journal, 20, 11, pp. 987-1018, (1999); Chesbrough H., Making sense of Corporate Venture Capital, Harvard Business Review, 80, 3, pp. 90-99, (2002); Chesbrough H., (2003); Chesbrough H., Appleyard M., Open innovation and strategy, California Management Review, 50, 1, pp. 57-76, (2007); Chesbrough H., Crowther A., Beyond high tech: Early adopters of open innovation in other industries, R&D Management, 36, pp. 229-236, (2006); Christensen C., Overdorf M., Meeting the challenge of disruptive change, Harvard Business Review, 66, (2000); Cohen W., Levinthal D., Absorptive capacity: A new perspective on learning and innovation, Administrative Science Quarterly, 35, pp. 128-152, (1990); Cooper R., The stage-gate idea-to-launch process - update, what's new, and NexGen Systems, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 25, pp. 213-232, (2008); Eisenhardt K., Building theories from case study research, Academy of Management Review, 14, 4, pp. 532-550, (1989); Eisenhardt K., Martin J., Dynamic capabilities: What are they?, Strategic Management Journal, 21, 10-11, pp. 1105-1122, (2000); Endlich L., Optical illusions, (2004); Enkel E., Gassmann O., Chesbrough H., Open R&D and open innovation: Exploring the phenomenon, R&D Management, 39, 4, pp. 311-316, (2009); Ferrary M., The gift exchange in the Social Networks of Silicon Valley, California Management Review, 45, 4, pp. 120-138, (2003); Ferrary M., Managing disruptive technologies life cycle by externalizing the research.

Design/methodology/approach: The definition gap existent and the multiplicity of fields and composite studies on collaborative ecosystems have made it necessary to conduct a systematic literature review of the phenomenon, a bibliometric analysis and content analysis. Findings: The research offers an overview of the phenomenon, three main cluster categories emerged: ecosystem, competition and open innovation; this cluster offers a comprehensive schematization of the research topics. Research limitations/implications: Limitations of this research are that the investigation has been confined to specific keywords related to collaborative ecosystems that led to a strict selection of papers to be analyzed and in having confined the investigation to publications in the managerial area. Further research will be able to expand the selection of keywords or use more strings and proceed to a comparative analysis of results. Another limitation is the small number of databases assessed (only Scopus and Web of Science) and have confined the analysis to specific clusters that emerged from the quantitative analysis of papers. Practical implications: By proposing a taxonomy of collaborative ecosystems, the paper highlights what solutions and architectures an ecosystem manager must consider when developing collaborative ecosystems, what factors he or she must pay attention to in order to ensure their development and survival, and what elements determine the development of an ecosystem, in particular, the management of innovation and knowledge and the scarcity of resources in a hyper-competitive environment. Originality/value: A combination of research methods was used to identify the intellectual structure of collaborative ecosystems. In addition, we propose a taxonomy for collaborative ecosystems, opening the study to new lines of investigation and providing a new research agenda. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bibliometric analysis;

Such a static view, however, ignores the fact that a firm's portfolio of external knowledge sources evolves over time. Our study attempts to address this gap by clarifying how temporal variations in a firm's knowledge sourcing activities (i.e., changes in external search breadth and external search depth) affect its radical innovative performance. We conceptualize temporal variations as encompassing simple change events (i.e., single transformative events captured through increases or decreases in breadth and depth) and multiple change events (i.e., repeated changes captured through increases and/or decreases in breadth and depth); and then develop theoretical arguments that draw on the organization learning theory. We find that asymmetries emerge when comparing simple and multiple change events in external breadth and external depth. Our findings contribute to prior research on open innovation by providing insights into the temporal dynamics and evolution of knowledge sourcing activities. © 2024 The Authors","External search breadth; External search depth; Innovative performance; Temporal variations","","","","","","","","Akgun A.E., Lynn G.S., Yilmaz C., Learning process in new product development teams and effects on product success: A socio-cognitive perspective, Industrial Marketing Management, 35, 2, pp. 210-224, (2006); Aliasghar O., Sadeghi A., Rose E.L., Process innovation in small-and medium-sized enterprises: The critical roles of external knowledge sourcing and absorptive capacity, Journal of Small Business Management, 61, 4, pp. 1583-1610, (2023); Allison P.D., Fixed effects regression models, (2009); Amburgey T.L., Miner A.S., Strategic momentum: The effects of repetitive, positional, and contextual momentum on merger activity, Strategic Management Journal, 13, 5, pp. 335-348, (1992); Angelidou S., Mount M., Pandza K., Exploring the asymmetric complementarity between external knowledge search and management innovation, Technovation, 115, (2022); Ardito L., Petruzzelli A.M., Breadth of external knowledge sourcing and product innovation: The moderating role of strategic human resource practices, European Management Journal, 35, 2, pp. 261-272, (2017); Argote L., Organizational learning: creating, Retaining and Transferring, 25, pp. 45-58, (1999); Argote L., Miron-Spektor E., Organizational learning: From experience to knowledge, Organization Science, 22, 5, pp. 1123-1137, (2011); Arnold V., Collier P.A., Leech S.A., Rose J.M., Sutton S.G., Can knowledge based systems be designed to counteract deskilling effects?, International Journal of Accounting Information Systems, 50, (2023); Asimakopoulos G., Revilla A.J., Slavova K., External knowledge sourcing and firm innovation efficiency, British Journal of Management, 31, 1, pp. 123-140, (2020); Badir Y.F., Frank B., Bogers M., Employee-level open innovation in emerging markets: Linking internal, external, and managerial resources, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 48, pp. 891-913, (2020); Beck N., Bruderl J., Woywode M., Momentum or deceleration?

Both subgroup and meta-analytic regression analyses were employed to analyse 106 independent peer-reviewed articles, encompassing 557,642 firms and 138 effects. Results showed a positive, significant relationship between OI and overall firm performance (r= 0.20) while revealing numerous contingencies. Particularly, we found that the effect of OI on non-financial performance (r= 0.20) is larger than that on financial performance (r= 0.19), while the disaggregate results revealed that inbound OI has the strongest effect on firm performance (r= 0.23), followed by outbound OI (r= 0.19) and coupled OI (r= 0.14). Furthermore, it was found that the mixed results are driven by both contextual factors (i.e., firm size, culture, study region, sector, and industry intensity) and measurement moderators (i.e., study measure and data type). Both the theoretical and managerial implications of these findings are elucidatedly discussed. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.","firm performance; meta-analysis; Open innovation","","","","","","","","Ahn J, Mortara L, Minshall T, Linkage between CEO characteristics and OI adoption in innovative SMEs, In DRUID Academy Conf.

In response, this study develops and evaluates a novel platform for dynamic room cleaning and resource allocation, guided by open innovation principles and complexity theory. Specifically, we propose the Artificial Multiple Intelligence System (AMIS), which employs heuristic-based optimization to coordinate real-time task assignments and ensure equitable workloads for housekeeping staff. We conducted a pilot implementation at a hotel in Ubon Ratchathani Province, Thailand, using a mixed-method approach that combined quantitative metrics with qualitative feedback. Our findings indicate that the AMIS framework substantially improves operational performance, as evidenced by more than a 50 % reduction in average room turnaround times and a task completion rate surpassing 99 %. Additionally, the system promotes balanced workloads and reduces employee working hours, suggesting practical avenues for sustainable workforce management. Beyond operational gains, the platform enhances guest satisfaction by enabling on-demand service customization, underscoring its potential as a source of competitive advantage. By examining both resource efficiency and service personalization, this study sheds light on how AI-driven solutions can address the complexities inherent in hospitality operations. The insights gained extend beyond routine scheduling, demonstrating how computational innovations, when carefully integrated with managerial strategies, can foster adaptable and forward-looking business models. Ultimately, the AMIS framework contributes to discussions on leveraging technology to modernize service delivery and operational planning, while also highlighting broader implications for AI adoption in dynamic service industries. © 2025 The Authors","Artificial intelligence; Dynamic scheduling; Guest satisfaction; Operational efficiency; Service personalization","","","","","","National Science, Research and Innovation Fund; NSRF; Ubon Ratchathani University, (4775475)","Funding text 1: The research was supported by the National Science, Research and Innovation Fund (NSRF) and Ubon Ratchathani University, under Grant No. 4775475.

As nations increasingly rely on knowledge assets to grow, the adoption of OSS will have profound economic consequences. This paper identifies the mechanisms inherent to OSS production that help fuel innovation in knowledge-based economies. As a collaborative and open production model, OSS is conceptualized as a prototype of open innovation. Drawing on US employment projections for 2008-2018, the authors' analysis predicts OSS will have a positive impact on employment growth in well-paid salary jobs across multiple sectors of the US economy. OSS-related software development jobs are widely diffuse throughout the economy, help build a skilled labour force and offer wages significantly above the national average. OSS is thus believed to be a strong contributor to growth in high-value employment in the US. The authors also posit that, as industries are exposed to the benefits of OSS as a result of the broad diffusion of OSS-related jobs, open innovation processes outside software development may be adopted through a process of learning and imitation. © 2014, IGI Global.

Design/methodology approach: Interviews sought the views of diverse network participants, including companies, universities, and government agencies. Findings: The open innovation networks exhibited many of the same tensions discussed in innovation initiatives within organizations, but additional complexities arose from both internal and external factors. Research limitations/implications: The study examined open innovation networks when the collaboration in the networks was still in early phases. Thus, the study does not capture the paradoxes, underlying tensions, and management approaches as they change in later phases. Practical implications: The open innovation networks require the ability to excel in managing a set of paradoxical tensions using a complex repertoire of approaches. Open innovation can be seen as an important way to create dynamicity and change, and if managers are able to manage tensions using a complex set of behavioral approaches, they can more likely achieve increased innovation. Originality/value: The open innovation literature recognizes paradoxes but does not address their management directly. This paper deepens the understanding of paradoxical tensions and their management across open innovation networks that take the form of public-private partnerships. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Finland; Innovation; Innovation networks; Open innovation; Paradox management; Tensions","","","","","","","","Alexy O., Criscuolo P., Salter A., Does IP strategy have to cripple open innovation?, MIT Sloan Management Review, 51, 1, pp. 71-77, (2009); Almirall E., Casadesus-Masanell R., Open versus closed innovation: A model of discovery and divergence, Academy of Management Review, 35, 1, pp. 27-47, (2010); Andriopoulos C., Lewis M.W., Exploitation-exploration tensions and organizational ambidexterity: Managing paradoxes and innovation, Organization Science, 20, 4, pp. 696-717, (2009); Bagley C.E., Winning legally: The value of legal astuteness, Academy of Management Review, 33, 2, pp. 378-390, (2008); Bartel C.A., Garud R., The role of narratives in sustaining organizational innovation, Organization Science, 20, 1, pp. 107-117, (2009); Birkinshaw J., Paradox of corporate entrepreneurship, Strategy+Business, 30, pp. 46-58, (2003); Bloodgood J.M., Chae B.K., Organizational paradoxes: Dynamic shifting and integrative management, Management Decision, 48, 1, pp. 85-104, (2010); Brown S.L., Eisenhardt K.M., The art of continuous change: Linking complexity theory and time-paced evolution in relentlessly shifting organizations, Administrative Science Quarterly, 42, pp. 1-34, (1997); Chesbrough H.W., Open Innovation: The New Imperative for Creating and Profiting from Technology, (2003); Chesbrough H.W., Garman A.R., How open innovation can help you cope in lean times, Harvard Business Review, 87, 12, pp. 68-76, (2009); Christensen C.M., Raynor M.E., The Innovator's Solution: Creating and Sustaining Successful Growth, (2003); Christensen J.F., Olesen H.M., Kjaer J.S., The industrial dynamics of open innovation - evidence from the transformation of consumer electronics, Research Policy, 34, pp. 1533-1549, (2005); Corbin J., Strauss A., Basics of Qualitative Research, (2008); Corley E.A., Boardman P.C., Bozeman B., Design and the management of multi-institutional research collaborations: Theoretical implications from two case studies, Research Policy, 35, 7, pp. 975-993, (2006); Dahlander L., Gann D.M., How open is innovation?, Research Policy, 39, pp. 699-709, (2010); Demil B., Lecocq X., Neither market nor hierarchy nor network: The emergence of bazaar governance, Organization Studies, 27, 10, pp. 1447-1466, (2006); Demison D.R., Hooijberg R., Quinn R.E., Paradox and performance: Toward a theory of behavioral complexity in managerial leadership, Organization Science, 6, pp. 524-540, (1995); Dodgson M., Gann D., Salter A., The role of technology in the shift towards open innovation: The case of Procter and Gamble, R&D Management, 36, 3, pp. 333-346, (2006); Dougherty D., Sustained product innovation in large, mature organizations: Overcoming innovation-to-organization problems, The Academy of Management Journal, 39, 5, pp. 1120-1153, (1996); Dougherty D., Organizing for innovation in the twenty-first century, The Sage Handbook of Organization Studies, pp. 598-617, (2006); Eisenhardt K.M., Paradox, spirals, ambivalence: The new language of change and pluralism, Academy of Management Review, 25, 4, pp. 703-705, (2000); Faraj S., Jarvenpaa S.L., Majchrzak A., Knowledge collaboration in online communities, Organization Science, (2011); Fiol C.M., Capitalizing on paradox: The role of language in transforming organizational identities, Organization Science, 13, pp. 653-666, (2002); Gassman O., Opening up the innovation process: Towards an agenda, R&D Management, 36, 3, pp. 223-228, (2006); Gebert D., Boerner S., Kearney E., Fostering team innovation: Why is it important to combine opposing action strategies?, Organization Science, 21, 2, pp. 593-608, (2010); Gibson C.R., Birkinshaw J., The antecedents, consequences, and mediating role of organizational ambidexterity, Academy of Management Journal, 47, pp. 209-2006, (2004); Heiman B.A., Nickerson J.A., Empirical evidence regarding the tension between knowledge sharing and knowledge expropriation in collaborations, Managerial and Decision Economics, 25, pp. 401-420, (2004); Jelinek M., Schoonhoven C., The Innovation Marathon: Lessons from High Technology Firms, (1990); Kale P., Singh H., Managing strategic alliances: What do we know now, and where do we go from here?, Academy of Management Perspectives, pp. 45-62, (2009); Kale P., Singh H., Perlmutter H., Learning and protection of proprietary assets in strategic alliances: Building relational capital, Strategic Management Journal, 23, SPEC.

The author did a brief review of innovation landscape included theories on unique resources and core competencies, the creation and dissemination of organizational knowledge, learning organization and organizational learning, the types of innovation and the emphasis on the concept of open innovation. Researchers have not fully elucidated the search for a link between corporate culture and innovation. For this study, the relationship between some of the main components of the organization – leadership, structure, strategy – is outlined to feature the main characteristics of the innovation culture domain, according to the views of the author. By previous theoretical and empirical studies, the author draws the main dimensions of the culture of innovation and emphasizing the trinity strategy-structure-culture and has created a model of the culture of innovation with concrete indicators. The conclusions are related to the complexity and varied manifestations of the impact of corporate culture on innovation in the company as well as on the complexity of defining a certain and very specific typology of the culture of innovation. The essence of the model represents the interrelationship between strategy and corporate culture, but with the appropriate structure, as well as leaders, for understanding the overall positive importance of the culture of innovation. The guiding principle for managing the culture of innovation in the discovery of specific features to encourage members of the specific organization for framing, sharing and act by the values that support the realization of innovation and implementation of innovative processes. One of the most important features of the culture of innovation identifies it as associated with change and perception, and as a set of possibilities. The culture of innovation is in line with the realization of experiments, risk-taking, the redefinition of parameters from the work activities. It is an interaction – amongst all the stakeholder groups, the conditions of maximum transparency, ensuring distribution, sharing, generating knowledge, like trust, as a construct that brings together the members of the organization in the realization of its future. © Economic Research Institute at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, 2018.","","","","","","","","","Claver E., Llopis J., Garcia D., Molina H., Organizational Culture for Innovation and New Technological Behavior, The Journal of High Technology Management Research, 9, 1, pp. 55-58, (1995);

Exploring several paradigms and theories, the present study was conceived with the goal of determining whether self-organization and organizational learning can indeed affect open innovation environments (OIEs). By collecting field data on the current status of self-organization and learning, this study investigates the impact of the two processes in OIEs on startups. The relationship between self-organization and learning is assessed using structural equation modeling (SEM). After validating the developed model, the cooperative games of the startups in the aforementioned OIE are examined. In the end, the economic value of each startup is obtained through game theory and the Shapley value. The studied startups were valued in both open and closed innovation environments to assess the economic implications of investment under the two paradigms. The results confirm that making investments is more justifiable when a startup is part of an OIE. Moreover, the value of each startup further increased in OIE due to the synergistic effect of collaborating with other startups in the innovation network. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.","Game theory; Learning; Open innovation; Self-organization; Startup","","","","","","","","Adner R., Match your innovation strategy to your innovation ecosystem, Harvard Business Review, 84, 4, (2006); Allen P., Maguire S., McKelvey B., Complexity and Management, (2011); Ayas K., Professional project management: A shift towards learning and a knowledge creating structure, International Journal of Project Management, 14, 3, pp. 131-136, (1996); Basic M., The influence of international knowledge and skills and firm internationalization on open innovation, Open Innovation: Unveiling the Power of the Human Element, pp. 191-219, (2017); Basic M., How does open business model transform elements of innovation culture into open innovation practices of high and low internationalisation firms?, Journal of the Knowledge Economy, pp. 1-27, (2022); Basic M., Organisational learning antecedents and open innovation: Differences in internationalisation level, International Journal of Innovation Studies, 5, 4, pp. 161-174, (2021); Blank S., Four Steps to the Epiphany, (2020); (N.d.).

This study explores how information technology capability (ITC) and entrepreneurial orientation (EO) in°uence a ¯rm's external search strategies and impact its IP. A survey of listed German ¯rms (n ¼ 146) found no support for a curvilinear relationship between open external search strategies and IP. Moreover, the assumption that ITC positively a®ects the relationship between external search strategy openness and IP was unsupported, proposing a negative moderating impact of ITC. The study observes that EO has di®erential moderating and direct e®ects on external search strategy e®ectiveness and its collective impact on IP. © 2024 World Scientific.

It covers topics of information and innovation, including national and regional systems of innovation; clustered and networked firms; and open-source/open-innovation production and use. Its final chapter on policy perspectives and decisions confirms the value of the toolset. Written so chapters can be used independently, the book includes simulation packages and pedagogical supplements. Its formal, accessible treatment of complexity goes beyond the scopes of neoclassical and mainstream economics. The highly interdependent economy of the 21st century demands a reconsideration of orthodox economic theories. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Using data from A-share and Science and Technology Innovation Board (STAR Market) listed companies in China from 2003 to 2022, we employ a two-way fixed effects model to examine the impact of OI on firms’ CE practices. The empirical results indicate that OI significantly promotes CE practices, influencing these practices through mechanisms such as trade credit provision, green patent accumulation, and enhanced information exchange. Moreover, government CE policies can strengthen the effect of OI on CE practices. Additionally, intercompany OI has a stronger positive impact on CE practices compared with intracompany and cooperative OI. The effects of OI and the moderating influence of CE policies are more pronounced in the eastern region, which is likely driven by superior industrialization in the region. These findings clarify the relationship between OI and CE practices to advance global CE practices. Future research could explore broader datasets, adopt alternative OI indicators, and conduct cross-country comparisons to further expand this research. © 2025","Circular economy policies; Circular economy practices; Green patents; Open innovation; Trade credit","","","","","","Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province, (ZR2022QG044); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province; Major Program of National Fund of Philosophy and Social Science of China, (23&ZD174); Major Program of National Fund of Philosophy and Social Science of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (72173012); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This study was supported by the Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation (Grant no.

How SMEs manage the balance between potential benefits and associated risks remains an overlooked topic in the literature. In parallel, recognizing the need for a more fine-grained level of analysis, we introduce the concept of OI moves to disentangle the OI projects of SMEs. An ‘OI move’ is defined as the set of managerial decisions and actions that are executed to reach specific innovation outputs in the framework of a collaboration with a single partner that is conducted as a part of an OI project. An OI move consist of the combination of two building blocks: a) the type of partner chosen to innovate with - ‘who is the SME innovating with’ and b) the exploitation mode - ‘who is exploiting the result’. Using the OI move as the level of the present analysis, we argue that different OI moves have the potential of delivering different benefits, but they also represent different levels of risk. To that end, the aim of our research is to explore how SMEs weigh benefits and risks at the level of OI move. On the basis of a unique data set of 106 in-depth case studies of innovation projects carried out by innovative SMEs located in Europe, 500 OI moves were identified. Clustering the extracted OI moves based on a typology formed by the combination of the type of partners and the exploitation mode revealed: a) benefits sought, b) risks encountered c) the type of partnership chosen. Findings of the study rely on the attention-based view of the firm as it provides an interesting lens through which OI is executed. Three main findings derive from the study. First, an SME initiates an OI move not only on the basis of the potential economic return. Albeit, it is the ‘attention capital’ required to create and capture value that is the SMEs' starting point in considering an OI partnership. Second, we find a ‘paradox’: SMEs tend to practice OI because they lack resources, but it is precisely the lack of resources that makes them reluctant to enter into attention-intensive OI partnerships even if return can be substantial. Third, OI moves involving communities and crowds are a ‘new playing field’ for SMEs. Because of their novelty, SMEs are reluctant to initiate such an OI move even though case-based evidence in our research demonstrates that SMEs using such collaborative forms can be quite successful. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Attention-based view of the firm; Exploitation mode; Multiple case study; Open innovation; Open innovation move; Open innovation typology; SME","Attention-based view of the firm; Attention-based views; Exploitation mode; Multiple-case study; Open innovation; Open innovation move; Open innovation typology; Small-and-medium enterprise; Risk assessment","","","","","European Commission, EC; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (691440)","This research is based on data collected by the INSPIRE project (H2020 project under grant agreement No 691440) funded by the European Commission.

This article aims to explore how businesses leverage open innovation (OI) practices to tackle social challenges in collaboration with SI stakeholders. We performed a multiple case study in three large manufacturing enterprises that are well-known for their excellence in innovation in terms of both SI impacts and OI depth. Results show that businesses develop and nurture a set of SI capabilities founded on purposeful knowledge exchanges across organizational boundaries, enhancing innovativeness, sustaining SI, and enlarging SI social and economic outcomes. The article provides key insights into the interplay between OI and SI, still underinvestigated in the literature, identifying the capabilities that should be fostered in the innovation processes of companies tackling broad societal challenges with openness. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Circular economy; innovation capabilities; multiple case studies; open innovation (OI); social innovation (SI); stakeholder engagement","Economics; Circular economy; Collaboration; Innovation capability; Multiple-case study; Open innovation; Open innovation, social innovation; Social innovations; Stakeholder; Stakeholder engagement; Technological innovation; Economic and social effects","","","","","","","Cajaiba-Santana G., Social innovation: Moving the field forward.

As a contribution in its own right to the innovation literature, the review clarifies the concept of complexity, explores possible points of relevance and the “added value” gained from complexity theory CT) to the study of innovation, and identifies some of the applications of the theory. Design/methodology/approach – A literature search was conducted which yielded 20 relevant articles. These articles were analyzed by focusing on the key concepts of complexity and studying their applications in the context of innovation research. Findings – Based on the approach adopted, the literature was divided into three categories, namely research focusing on microdynamics, macrodynamics, and leadership and management. The key complexity concepts identified in the innovation literature were “edge of chaos”, “phase shift”, “emergence and self-organization”, “co)evolution”, and “complexity regulation”. The articles reviewed differed in terms of their perspectives on complexity and, accordingly, their operationalization of the complexity concepts. Key areas of development suggested by the authors include forging a stronger link with existing innovation theory and giving greater weight to empirical evidence. Research limitations/implications – While a systematic review strategy was adopted to identify all relevant research on “open innovation” and complexity, a selective snowball strategy was deemed the only feasible approach to cover research conducted on “innovation” and complexity. Practical implications – Practitioners can learn to put CT-based research in context and also learn to recognize the value of CT for innovation management. The authors distilled three important lessons for practice from the research done: embracing complexity, embracing ambidexterity, and embracing failure. Originality/value – To the best of the authors’ knowledge no review has as yet been undertaken to encapsulate the current state of applications of CT to innovation research. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Complex adaptive systems; Complexity perspective; Complexity theory; Innovation; Innovation process; Open innovation","","","","","","","","*Aasen T.M.B., Johannessen S., Exploring innovation processes from a complexity perspective.

A mail survey of small IFAs was undertaken utilising previously validated scales to assess business performance in relation to networking and open innovation.

Although concepts such as dynamic capabilities help to address this challenge, managerial instructions for achieving a sustainable competitiveness do not often reach beyond the surface. Therefore some researchers suggest investigating the sensing capability, or the capability to recognize market opportunities and threats, which is one dimension of the dynamic capabilities. In this paper, we derive the key market knowledge sourcing determinants of the sensing capability of industrial firms in general, and under high, medium, and low levels of market dynamism and link them to revenue growth. Our results provide industrial (marketing) managers new insights on how to effectively use various sources of market knowledge to sense market opportunities and threats. We use second respondent-validated survey data from top managers at 483 internationally operating industrial firms to test hypotheses and complement it with objective revenue growth data. Surprisingly, while competitor sourcing negatively affects sensing capabilities under low and medium dynamic markets, research institution sourcing positively affects it, particularly under high dynamic markets. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Digital transformation; Dynamic capabilities; Market knowledge sourcing; Market opportunity; Market orientation; Market threat; Open innovation; Revenue growth; Sensing capability","","","","","","Academy of Marketing, AM; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (GZ975)","Funding text 1: We thank Ajay Kohli, Tobias Kretschmer, and Neil Morgan for helpful suggestions and discussions on a previous version of this paper.

Therefore, innovation has become a critical success factor in the creation of ‘smart cities’. A smart city is one that uses technology as a platform to serve its citizens’ needs and foster innovative processes that enhance their quality of life. In this chapter, the authors present two case studies of urban open innovation processes in, respectively, Haifa in Israel and Bremerhaven in Germany, which demonstrate the engagement of all stakeholders, motivated by passion, altruism and the desire to cooperate. The first case concerns open innovation with the young, and the second open innovation with the elderly. Both case studies demonstrate how passion led to altruism which encouraged citizens to volunteer to contribute and co-create a better future for all the city’s residents by enabling better communication among stakeholders in the context of a complex urban environment. © 2018 by Emerald Publishing Limited.","Altruism; Community; Innovation ecosystem; Motivation; Open innovation; Smart city","","","","","","","","Drucker P.F., What business can learn from nonprofits, Harvard Business Review, 67, 4, pp. 88-93, (1989); Drucker P.F., Post-capitalist society, (1994); Dvir R., Pasher E., Innovation engines for knowledge cities: An innovation ecology perspective, Journal of Knowledge Management, 8, 5, pp. 16-27, (2004); Edvinsson L., Dvir R., Roth N., Pasher E., Innovations: The new unit of analysis in the knowledge era, Journal of Intellectual Capital, 5, 1, pp. 40-58, (2004); Hamel G., The future of management, (2007); Heifetz R.A., Laurie D.L., The work of leadership, Harvard Business Review, 75, 1, pp. 124-134, (1997); Kroger T., Brell M., Lipprandt M., Muller F., Helmer A., Hein A., IDEAAL, der Mensch im Mittelpunkt, (2011); Lave J., Wenger E., Situated learning: Legitimate peripheral participation, (1991); Lawo M., Herzog O., Boronowsky M., Knackfuss P., The Open Wearable Computing Group, IEEE Pervasive Computing, 10, 2, pp. 78-81, (2011); Marsh A., Biniaris C., Vergados D., Eppler A., Kawadias C., Bigalke O., Caragiozidis M., An assisted-living home architecture with integrated healthcare services for elderly people, Studies in Health Technology and Informatics, 137, pp. 93-103, (2008); Martin D., Jane Jacobs, urban activist, is dead at 89, New York Times, (2006); Maxwell J.C., Leadership gold: Lessons I’ve learned from a lifetime of leading, (2008); Mitleton-Kelly E., Ten principles of complexity & enabling infrastructures, Complex systems and evolutionary perspectives on organisations: The application of complexity theory to organisations, pp. 23-50, (2003); Muller F., Hoffmann P., Frenken M., Hoffmann P., Hein A., Herzog O., Länger selbstbestimmt Wohnen -Vernetzte Hausautomatisierung im Realeinsatz.

Extant literature argues that MNCs can be viewed as knowledge sharing networks and that knowledge exchange within the group enhances performance. This exploration of new knowledge through search among peer subsidiaries of the parent MNC can be regarded as Internal Open Innovation (IOI). However, literature on Open Innovation is largely focused on the external boundary of the firm, so that little can be said on whether openness towards corporate group internal knowledge sources is either or both, beneficial and/or detrimental, and how this depends on the difference of national industries and on the correct communication of these before the final transfer of knowledge. The principal research question thus is: To what degree should MNC subsidiaries be open to their intra-MNC peers given a common, evolving technological environment but different local market contexts? In this paper, the authors contribute with new propositions regarding this issue developed based on results from an agent-based model that is analyzed through computer simulation. The authors explore the degree of openness of MNC subsidiaries together with their communication competence in different organizational structures and environments, based on previous developments in theory of knowledge transfer and complexity as well as international business. © 2015, IGI Global.

Effective management of the knowledge and information transferred between ecosystem partners is crucial for the process of open innovation. However, to date, limited research has focused on ascertaining the conditions required for knowledge transfer success, particularly where the context involves collaboration between diverse organizational actors. Correspondingly, this study extends existing knowledge by presenting an exploration of conditions for knowledge transfer success between ecosystem partners. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with thirty key stakeholders in order to acquire their perceptions of the presence of specific conditions within their ecosystem partnerships. Empirical data were analyzed using a fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis approach, resulting in the production of success recipes from multinational, small and medium-sized enterprise, and academic institution perspectives. Results indicate that combinations of knowledge, relationship, and organizational characteristics contribute to knowledge transfer success. However, these combinations are found to be dependent on the type of ecosystem partnership involved. Theoretical and practical implications of the study are presented, along with acknowledged limitations and suggestions for further work. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Co-creation; Ecosystem; fsQCA; Knowledge transfer;

Policy MD Group, Office of Strategic R&D Planning (OSP), Seoul, 06152, South Korea","In recent years, crowdfunding has attracted the attention of tech startups. It has become a good alternative way to readily raise funds, especially during the early startup stages. However, in the case of mass intelligence, it is quite difficult to ensure the accuracy and reliability of knowledge. Individual investors who are not experts in science and technology often face difficulties investing in technology companies. In this regard, a new type of collective intelligence formed by accredited professionals needs to be attempted. This paper explores an alternative crowdfunding model for enhancing access to technology investments by the general population through an investor acceptance model. We developed an investor acceptance model to examine how the crowdfunding model involving scientists and engineers is adopted by individual investors using survey data from the general population. The results revealed that individual investors have a positive attitude towards investing through the crowdfunding model when they perceive that the information provided by a group of scientific experts is useful. We found that the perceived usefulness of the information from scientists and engineers is affected by the perceived quality of the information and perceived credibility of the scientists and engineers. We also suggest a basic concept for the crowdfunding model utilizing the collective intelligence of scientists and engineers for tech startups. The results could suggest a policy direction for promoting innovation. © 2021 by the authors.

The purpose of this paper is to explore, from a firm-level perspective, organizational characteristics for continuous innovation in rapidly changing industries. Design/methodology/approach: Findings from 28 interviews at Google Inc., are compared to previous research on organizational characteristics for continuous innovation. Findings: Google's organization can be viewed as a dynamic and open corporate system for continuous innovation, involving the entire organization and supported by an innovation-oriented and change-prone top management and board. The relative importance of eight organizational characteristics in this corporate system is elaborated upon. Research limitations/implications: There is a need for empirical research contributing to the development of a more comprehensive analytical framework for continuous innovation, including the role of culture and selection/facilitation of self-organizing individuals in innovation processes; and to study how to organize for both continuous innovation and continuous improvements. Practical implications: The importance of factors such as culture and the selection of individuals, identified in the empirical study, needs to be considered by managers, and might influence their understanding of how to sustain continuous innovation over time. Originality/value: This paper provides, from a firm-level perspective and based on a unique access to empirical data, increased understanding of organizational characteristics conducive to continuous innovation in rapidly changing industries, and highlights the importance of characteristics that received less emphasis in previous research literature. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate innovation system; Dynamic capability; Google; Human resource management; Innovation management; Open innovation; Organizational culture; Organizational design","","","","","","","","Ahmed P.K., Culture and climate for innovation, European Journal of Innovation Management, 1, 1, pp. 30-43, (1998); Alange S., Steiber A., The board's role in sustaining major organizational change, International Journal of Quality and Service Sciences, 1, 3, pp. 280-293, (2009); Arad S., Hanson M.A., Scheider R.J., A framework for the study of relationships between organizational characteristics and organizational innovation, The Journal of Creative Behavior, 31, 1, pp. 42-58, (1997); Auletta K., Googled: The End of the World as We Know It, (2009); Boer H., Gertsen F., From continuous improvement to continuous innovation: A (retro)(per)spective, Int.

Leadership styles are external expressions of internally held leadership paradigms, which are themselves both reflections of broader shifts of consciousness within society, as well as the process of individual human development. Complexity theory shows us that innovation is optimized at the “edge of chaos,” where the optimum balance between structure and freedom is found. Early stage research requires a high level of freedom to experiment and explore opportunities through collaborative engagement with both internal and external networks. The challenge for many large pharmaceutical companies is to reproduce the kind of creative culture that exists in small biotech; however, many leaders do not understand how to do this. Others switch to in-licensing or buy-in strategies that also requires an entrepreneurial outlook to be successful and that tends to be lacking in risk-averse pharma. Altogether, there is growing evidence of the limits of the prevailing leadership paradigm (achievement–pluralistic) in addressing the innovation deficit. The answers point toward nurturing the evolutionary leadership paradigm and building an “evolutionary bridge” of critical capabilities which make it possible to more fully embrace open innovation business strategies and models. © 2016 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Moreover, this emerging servitization literature is limited to the traditional lead-firm perspective within larger consortiums. To help redress the balance, our research studied six collaborative servitization projects in mobile information and communication technologies (mICT) to explore why some open innovation efforts succeed in simultaneous service and product innovation with a market application of innovative solution, while others do not. The study provides empirical evidence that only a small number of projects resulted in an effective servitization innovation solution. This conclusion emphasises the complexity of creating service innovation in the mICT sector. By comparing better performing servitization projects with those that were less successful suggests that higher performance, in terms of novel service development, requires more than mere strong intention, adequate leadership and change management competencies. Rather, it also requires real servitization maturity in terms of a shared servitization framework and market-oriented innovation. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Collaborative innovation projects; mICT; Service innovation; Servitization","","","","","","","","Aarikka-Stenroos L., Jaakkola E., Value co-creation in knowledge intensive business services: A dyadic perspective on the joint problem solving process, Industrial Marketing Management, 41, 1, pp. 15-26, (2012); Adner R., Ecosystem as structure: An actionable construct for strategy, Journal of Management, 43, 1, pp. 39-58, (2017); Ahuja G., Collaboration networks, structural holes, and innovation: a longitudinal study, Administrative Science Quarterly, 45, pp. 425-455, (2000); Anand B.N., Khanna T., Do firms learn to create value?

However, there is a lack of theoretical underpinning to understand how and why co-creation by actors generate different types of social value in the concurrent pursuit of business and social value. Adopting an inductive case study approach, we find that different types of entrepreneurs who co-exploit co-identify opportunities for co-creation, generate potentially competing social and business values. We develop four propositions relating to how and why profit orientation and key resource contributions of entrepreneurs co-identifying an opportunity to co-create decide the nature of social value generated. We discuss avenues for future research and practical implications, underlying the importance of developing entrepreneurialism as ways to generate different social impacts through open innovation approaches, such as co-creation. © 2019 RADMA and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","","","","Big Innovation Centre; British Academy of Management, BAM","We are grateful to the British Academy of Management (Transition 1 Grant) and the Big Innovation Centre for supporting the data collection process.

Three main research questions are addressed: (1) what OI concepts are salient in their innovation portfolio?, (2) what OI concepts are used in the strategy formulation? and (3) what other concepts are present that augment OI? Interviews with 120 managers and archival documents were analyzed using thematic analysis. Two concepts prominent in the literature, (i) value capture models and (ii) technology evaluation criteria, were not present in this portfolio. By contrast, we found a focus on OI capability building, external information sharing and uncertain knowledge arbitrage in networks. Finally, we discuss these capabilities in relation to absorptive capacity, proposing a simple, but important bi-directional perspective to embrace OI. © 2010 The Authors.

There are a number of questions still unanswered that should be thoroughly addressed to improve our understanding of this emerging innovation management paradigm. This paper leverages recent research analysing the organisational change processes followed by low tech firms to move from closed to open innovation. It adds to this literature by analysing how the organisational change process is administered in four Italian companies operating in high tech industries. Thanks to the analysis, we identify several commonalities between high and low tech firms and we unearth some relevant differences. In particular, the paper stands for the generalisability of previous findings regarding the transition towards open innovation and the potential of reading this process through the lens of Lewin's theory of organisational change.

This research focuses on data from eighteen service SMEs in Belgium from high-tech and knowledge-intensive service industries. Based on analysis, we find new insights regarding open innovation practices (i.e., inbound and outbound) and sub-practices (i.e., acquiring, sourcing, selling and revealing) for service firms. More specifically, the study showed that service SMEs are more inclined to use inbound practices due to reasons associated with firm size, industry, and knowledge intensity in the market, whereas the decision about which sub-practice to adopt seems to be strongly influenced by the type of actor, the firm’s vulnerability and internal managerial skills, and the existence of complementarities. Thus, we contribute to OI literature as well as capability literature through providing initial insights regarding the adoption of OI by service firms. © 2015 Universidade do Porto - Faculdade de Engenharia.

Geographic diversity and collaborative breadth can effectively protect proprietary innovations that limit knowledge leakage concerns. Design/methodology/approach: Using a cross-industry sample from the Taiwanese Technological Innovation Survey III, which covered 1,519 firms, the authors investigate the conditions under which partnership portfolios affect radical innovation. Findings: The findings suggest that the partnership portfolio has an inverted U-shaped influence on radical innovation and that this relationship is moderated by geographic diversity and collaborative breadth. This work identifies a balance in the tension between diverse partnership portfolios and knowledge leakage with regard to open innovation activities. Practical implications: This study provides senior managers with an indication of the relationships between partnership portfolios and innovative knowledge protection, identifying the geographic diversity and collaborative breadth that serve as safeguards to prevent leakages of a firm’s innovative knowledge. Originality/value: This study makes an original contribution to the empirical exploration of innovation knowledge protection and provides new insights into the field of open innovation.

The TTIS III was designed following the guiding principles of the OECD\u2019s Oslo Innovation Manual (). The TTIS III was a large-scale government-led survey designed to collect data on firm-level innovation activities from various industries from 2007 to 2010, as well as information from the EU Community Innovation Survey (CIS) on innovation activities. A major strength of the TTIS III is that its data set is established, and it includes all manufacturing and service firms across all Taiwanese regions. The original survey questionnaire required senior managers to answer questions related to firm-level innovation processes and activities. The pretest and pilot studies confirmed the suitability of the survey across a comprehensive set of industries, helping determine and assess the effectiveness of the survey. Thus, the TTIS III is a reliable and valid data set on firm-level innovation activities and is thus suitable for innovation research (; ). ; Funding text 2: This paper is supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of the Republic of China, Taiwan (MOST 106\u20132410-H-415-038-MY2) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 72272136).","Abdulkader B., Magni D., Cillo V., Papa A., Micera R., Aligning firm's value system and open innovation: a new framework of business process management beyond the business model innovation, Business Process Management Journal, 26, 5, pp. 999-1020, (2020); Abernathy W., Clark K.B., Innovation: mapping the winds of creative destruction, Research Policy, 14, 1, pp. 3-22, (1985); Ahuja G., Katila R., Technological acquisitions and the innovation performance of acquiring firms: a longitudinal study, Strategic Management Journal, 22, 3, pp. 197-220, (2001); Anokhin S., Ortqvist D., Thorgren S., Wincent J., Corporate venturing deal syndication and innovation: the information exchange paradox, Long Range Planning, 44, 2, pp. 134-151, (2011); Ardito L., Petruzzelli A.M., Breadth of external knowledge sourcing and product innovation: the moderating role of strategic human resource practices, European Management Journal, 35, 2, pp. 261-272, (2017); Ardito L., Peruffo E., Natalicchio A., The relationships between the internationalization of alliance portfolio diversity, individual incentives, and innovation ambidexterity: a micro foundational approach, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 148, (2019); Attewell P., Technology diffusion and organizational learning: the case of business computing, Organization Science, 3, 1, pp. 1-19, (1992); Bahlmann M.D., Finding value in geographic diversity through prior experience and knowledge integration: a study of ventures’ innovative performance, Industrial and Corporate Change, 25, 4, pp. 576-589, (2015); Benner M.J., Tushman M.L., Exploitation, exploration, and process management: the productivity dilemma revisited, The Academy of Management Review, 28, 2, pp. 238-256, (2003); Berry H., Knowledge inheritance in global industries: the impact of parent firm knowledge on the performance of foreign subsidiaries, Academy of Management Journal, 58, 5, pp. 1438-1458, (2015); Bianchi M., Croce A., Dell'Era C., Di Benedetto C.A., Frattini F., Organizing for inbound open innovation: how external consultants and a dedicated R&D unit influence product innovation performance, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 33, 4, pp. 492-510, (2016); Bogers M., The open innovation paradox: knowledge sharing and protection in R&D collaborations, European Journal of Innovation Management, 14, 1, pp. 93-117, (2011); Boschma R.A., Proximity and innovation: a critical assessment, Regional Studies, 39, 1, pp. 61-74, (2005); Brown S.L., Eisenhardt K.M., The art of continuous change: linking complexity theory and time-paced evolution in relentlessly shifting organizations, Administrative Science Quarterly, 42, 1, pp. 1-34, (1997); Brusoni S., Prencipe A., Pavitt K., Knowledge specialization, organizational coupling, and the boundaries of the firm: why do firms know more than they make?, Administrative Science Quarterly, 46, 4, pp. 597-621, (2001); Cannella A.A., Park J.H., Lee H.U., Top management team functional background diversity and firm performance: examining the roles of team member colocation and environmental uncertainty, Academy of Management Journal, 51, 4, pp. 768-784, (2008); Caputo F., Magni D., Papa A., Corsi C., Knowledge hiding in socioeconomic settings: matching organizational and environmental antecedents, Journal of Business Research, 135, pp. 19-27, (2021); Cassiman B., Veugelers R., In search of complementarity in innovation strategy: internal R&D and external knowledge acquisition, Management Science, 52, 1, pp. 68-82, (2006); Cheng C.C.J., Huizingh E.K.R.E., When is open innovation beneficial?

In their development and renewal issues, businesses are facing an extensive and complex environment that requires them to have deep knowledge and create new solution alternatives. That is why the development of business and innovation systems and innovative enterprises and business networks must increasingly rely on research knowledge. The aim of this study is to cover the main areas of business and innovation systems in the enterprise and network context. The objective is to develop new theoretical and practical approaches and openings for analysing innovative enterprises and networks in a complex business environment. The premise of this study is that enterprises that have a fuller understanding of future innovative enterprises and networks as well as their strategic change patterns will be better able to renew their businesses and networks. The main finding of the study is that a paradigmatic change is ongoing in business and innovation systems as well as in production concepts. One of the reasons for this change is that enterprises are increasingly operating in a complex and changing environment. Another reason is that a new innovation paradigm is emerging that will question the early theoretical and practical premises of business and innovation concepts as well as the concepts of the firm and the network. This study explicates a new concept of cellular-networked enterprises based on an analysis of business systems and production concepts as well as on innovation and networked approaches. The theoretical view on business and innovation systems and their paradigms as well as on the viewpoints concerning business and industrial models is reviewed and analysed. In this study, the different theoretical approaches to the firm and network are reviewed and explicated. Four theoretical perspectives and models are analysed. The first three are: the mass production model, transaction cost approach and competence-based approach. The fourth is a new approach to firms and networks that is argued and supported in this study: the hyperinnovation approach. It is based on the premises of complexity theories, and the new theories on strategising and organising. Suitable strategic change models are then analysed. Three change models are distinguished: the planned change model, evolutionary change model and transformative change model. The transformative change model is an interesting new model that aims at radical steps for renewing businesses. Learning and innovation patterns are analysed and assessed. There are different means of creating and utilising knowledge in the organisation. Reflective action and the formulation of hypotheses advance the creation of new innovative knowledge and innovation activity. Drafting a development agenda is the key to creating something new in the organisation. However, the actor role is of the utmost importance in the innovation activities and knowledge-creation processes of the organisation. Innovative collaboration networks and their development are analysed and modelled. Four types of networks are explicated. The core firm model and strategic network model are mainly based on the exploitation of existing resources and competences, while the strategic alliance model and open innovation model are geared towards the exploration of new business opportunities. Collaborative networks cannot be thoroughly planned; there are always spontaneous elements in the formation of these networks. The planning and implementation issues of the competitive supply model, partner model, strategic network model and open innovation model are analysed and assessed. The development and renewal models of business systems and industries are analysed and assessed. The business systems change model shows the business and industry change dynamics through different dimensions. The business development model shows the many dimensions of transforming business activities. The model of the change patterns of firms and industries shows the meaning of incremental change and radical change for industrial renewal processes. The Finnish business system and its development are analysed and modelled. The Finnish business system has shown its dynamism. The development of the Finnish business system is modelled through many dimensions, from the beginning of the 1980s to the present. However, the Finnish business system has a number of complicating features, both now and especially in the future. As part of the Finnish business system, the growth and business strategies of medium sized firms are analysed and assessed. Four competitive and growth strategies are analysed and modelled: the systems supplier strategy, domestic-based strategy, niche strategy and system integrator strategy. In this study, the practical subject is business and its change models. Practical management models are reviewed and assessed. The central focus concerns the management issues of industrial services and business systems. Different aspects of firms' capabilities and management systems are reviewed and analysed. The change process and phases for service business as well as the strategic change model of business systems are analysed and assessed. Twelve business cases are described and analysed. The analysis is based on a model with three dimensions: resource exploitation, business renewal, and growth and internationalisation. A separate summary framework is created. The framework consists of the following: increasing efficiency, business renewal, networks, growth and internationalisation. Research approaches and methods are analysed and modelled.

In previous studies, technological innovation capabilities were emphasized as a factor that enables SMEs to compete in the international market. To this end, SMEs need to cooperate with external partners to strengthen their technological innovation capabilities to thus improve their international performance. With the perspective view of open innovation, this research explores the effects of relational capital and technological innovation capability on international performance, with a particular focus on the moderating effect of alliance proactiveness. Building on previous literature regarding internationalization, technological innovation, and alliance proactiveness, research hypotheses were developed and tested using data collected from 175 SMEs. A hierarchical regression analysis was applied. The analysis showed that, first, relational capital had a significant effect on the technological innovation capability. Second, technological innovation capability has a significant influence on the international performance. Third, technological innovation capability mediated the relationship between relational capital and international performance. Finally, alliance proactiveness was found to moderate the relationship between technological innovation capability and international performance. The key research findings imply that relational capital and alliance proactiveness are the key factors of international performance, as they improved the development of the technological innovation capability. © 2021 by the authors.

Based on the principles of (i) self-organization and (ii) access to and management of complementary knowledge, the aim of the study is to present an alternative to the existing growth strategy for NTBFs. The open innovation growth strategy proposed here suggests that NTBFs should not try to become a large corporation, but instead constantly split into new ventures or engage (directly or indirectly) in the development of existing structures. These collaborative platforms are envisaged as the result of mutually beneficial complementary partnerships with customers, suppliers, competitors and/or partners. The open innovation growth strategy for NTBFs is initially developed on the request of A-Lighting, a NTBF operating in the turbulent environment of the LED lighting industry. The aim of the current research is to present the concept and apply it at A-Lighting in the framework of an ongoing action research project where the authors are implicated both as researchers and practitioners. Presenting a 'management innovation' from an early stage is believed to be an essential part of its development as this could produce valuable feedback and debate (Kaplan, 1998). The study concludes by suggesting further application of the concept. © 2012, IGI Global.","","","","","","","","","Allard-Poesi F., Marechal C., Constructing the research problem, Doing Management Research: A Comprehensive Guide, pp. 31-50, (2001); Angot J., Milano P., Linking concepts and data, Doing Management Research: A Comprehensive Guide, pp. 132-146, (2001); Autio E., New, technology-based Firms in innovation networks symplectic and generative impacts, Research Policy, 26, 9, pp. 263-281, (1997); Blomqvist K.-M., Stahle P., Trust in technology partnerships, Trust In Knowledge Management and Systems In Organizations, pp. 173-199, (2004); Brandenburger A., Nalebuff B., Co-Opetition, (1996); Bryant K., Wells A., The consequences of complexity: Implications of 'systemic economics, A New Economic Paradigm?

Using a configurational approach (involving complementarity and equifinality), we propose that firms use different OI configurations, by combining three openness practices (high number of alliances, partner diversity, and external R&D) and four complementary organizational assets (human capital, alliance coordination capabilities, inter-organizational learning capabilities, and patenting orientation), and that such configurations affect OI performance. We conducted a survey study on the Spanish biotech industry. A sample of 75 companies was analyzed using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). The results revealed seven high-performing configurations and six low-performing configurations. Configurations combining one or more OI practices and complementary organizational assets achieved a high OI performance, while open configurations lacking the necessary organizational assets were not successful. Closed configurations also performed poorly. The theoretical and managerial implications are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Alliance coordination capabilities; Human capital; Inter-organizational learning capabilities; Open innovation; Patenting orientation; R&D","Spain; Technological forecasting; Biotech industry; Complementary assets; Equifinality; Fuzzy Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis; Human capitals; Inter-organizational learning; Managerial implications; Open innovation; comparative study; human capital; innovation; learning; qualitative analysis; research and development; technological development","","","","","Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness; Spanish Minister of Economy and Competitiveness, (ECO2016-78882-R); Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN","Funding text 1: Acknowledgements: The authors acknowledge the financial support by the Spanish Minister of Economy and Competitiveness (Project ECO2016-78882-R ). ; Funding text 2: Gloria Cuevas-Rodriguez is Full Professor in the Management and Marketing Department at Pablo de Olavide University (Seville, Spain).

This strategic approach is known as inbound open innovation. The existing empirical evidence regarding the impact of inbound open innovation on performance, however, is ambiguous. The equivocal results are due to moderating factors that influence a firm's ability to acquire technological knowledge from external sources and to transform it into innovation outputs. This paper focuses on a relevant yet overlooked category of moderating factors: organization of research and development (R&D). It explores two organizational mechanisms: one informal and external-oriented (involvement of external consultants in R&D activities) and one formalized and internal-oriented (existence of a dedicated R&D unit), in the acquisition of technological knowledge through R&D outsourcing, a particular contractual form for inbound open innovation. Drawing on a capabilities perspective and using a longitudinal dataset of 841 Spanish manufacturing firms observed over the period 1999-2007, this paper provides a fine-grained analysis of the moderating effects of the two organizational mechanisms. The involvement of external consultants in R&D activities strengthens the impact of inbound open innovation on innovation performance by increasing marginal benefits of acquiring external technological knowledge through R&D outsourcing. Moreover, it reduces the level of inbound open innovation to which the highest innovation performance corresponds. Instead, the existence of a dedicated R&D unit makes the firm less sensitive to changes in the level of inbound open innovation, by reducing marginal benefits of acquiring external technological knowledge through R&D outsourcing, and increases the level of inbound open innovation to which the highest innovation performance corresponds. The results regarding the role of informal and formalized R&D organizational mechanisms contribute to research on open innovation and absorptive capacity, and also inform managers as to what organizational mechanism is recommended to acquire external technological knowledge, depending on the objectives that the firm pursues. © 2015 Product Development & Management Association.","","Knowledge management;

Internet applications have a significant facilitating effect on the quantity and quality of process innovation. However, from the perspective of the average marginal effect, the facilitating effect of Internet applications on the quantity of process innovation is greater than that on the quality of process innovation. Further analysing firm size, industry, ownership, and regional heterogeneity shows that in terms of the quantity of process innovation, Internet applications have a greater impact on small- and medium-sized firms, labour-intensive firms, non-state-owned firms, and eastern firms. As for the quality of process innovation, Internet applications have a stronger promoting effect on large firms, technology-intensive firms, and state-owned firms. The mechanism test reveals that open innovation and informatisation capability play a mediating role in the influence of a firm’s Internet applications on process innovation. This study provides micro-empirical evidence for firms’ Internet applications to promote process innovation and policy insights into China’s manufacturing transformation and upgrading. © 2022 The Author(s).

The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: Conceptually and theoretically, the paper emphasizes the importance of networking capability in network resources mobilization and deployment, innovation and rent-seeking and argues that the firm should build strong networking capability to creatively and artfully manage its networks to sustain its vitality. Findings: The paper builds a theoretical model relating networking capability, network resources, open innovation, and resulting new venture success and economic rents. The paper argues that new ventures should build and leverage networking capability to manage network relationships and resources to innovate, develop and create value, and appropriate various types of economic rent. Research limitations/implications: The framework generally promoted building networking capability as a means of accessing to a broader range of network resources and opportunities than a new venture is able to maintain internally for innovation and growth, the benefits may not be so clear-cut. A useful future research direction would be to determine empirically the relationship between networking capability and new ventures' survival and growth, the extent to which new ventures are able to derive economic rents from exploiting networking capability, and how this is related to the degrees of competitive success they attain. Practical implications: The research framework suggests that networking capability can help new ventures to take advantage of opportunities discovered and serve unexploited markets. The study implies that networking capability can be a powerful weapon for new ventures to implement open innovation strategy to build solid growth businesses and to gain sustainable competitive advantage. Originality/value: The paper develops a parsimonious model that links new venture survival and success with networking capability, network resources and open innovation. Also, this model shows why and how new ventures can leverage networking capability to generate and appropriate economic rent simultaneously. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Entrepreneurial marketing;

The role of ICT is important for problems like COVID-19. ICT based innovation is effective in responding to problems for industry, economy, and society. However, we need to understand, not from the perspective of performance or investment, that the use and performance of ICT technology are promoted when each country’s ICT related environment, policies, governance, and regulations are effective. We need to share sustainable ICT experiences, successes, and challenges to solve complex problems and reorganize policies. This study proposes a Text Mining methodology from a future-oriented perspective to extract semantic system patterns from International Telecommunication Union (ITU) professional reports. In the text extracted from the report, we found a new relationship pattern and a potential topic.

Based on an in-depth single-case study, we derive four major levels of IT requirements: incentive & inspiration, information & knowledge, communication & collaboration, and feedback & feed-forward. The multitude of requirements identified on each level clearly points to the need for IT support during the internal open innovation process. The paper concludes that many findings from prior research on innovation management systems apply to the internal open innovation context as well, but with some interesting differences. An IT system for open innovation within a company should pay particular attention to the incentives and inspiration of employees. The system should motivate all employees to participate in open innovation and stimulate innovative ideas by indicating clear benefits as well as recent needs, challenges and developments in their company's context. Furthermore, a virtual community seems to be a powerful concept for driving open innovation in the company. It fosters the activity of and the interaction between employees, thereby addressing all of our requirement levels. To build and run such an intraorganizational open innovation community, social software offers useful concepts and applications. Based on the identified requirements, we present initial concepts for their implementation.","Innovation Process; Internal Open Innovation; IT Support; Requirements; Social Software","Industry; Information systems; Management information systems; Virtual reality; Exploratory studies; Feed-Forward; Innovation management; Innovation network; Innovation process; Innovative ideas; IT system; Open innovation; Requirements; Social software; Virtual community; Innovation","","","","","","","Ardilio A., Auernhammer K., Kohn A., Marktstudie Innovationssysteme: IT-Unterstützung im Innovationsmanagement, (2004); Bartel A., Ichniowski C., Shaw K., How Does Information Technology Affect Productivity?

Data were acquired through a survey of middle and senior managers employed in Peruvian companies. Firms achieving higher sales growth did not exhibit more of an entrepreneurial orientation or utilize a double loop learning style. More entrepreneurial firms appear to have adopted a double loop learning approach to knowledge acquisition. Peruvian firms involved in open innovation reported higher sales growth and indicated greater reliance on the use of double loop learning. The practical implications of the study are that firms in emerging economies do not have to be reliant on entrepreneurial behaviour to sustain business growth. Nevertheless involvement in open innovation can be beneficial. The originality of this paper is that although the results are only for companies in Peru, the findings may suggest that firms operating in emerging economies need not necessarily rely on entrepreneurial behaviour to sustain business growth, although involvement in open innovation may enhance business performance. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Entrepreneurialism;

Design/methodology/approach – This research mainly employs three types of research methodologies: Literature study was conducted to connect this study with conventional theories in KM and propose the main principles of Mass Collaborative Knowledge Management (MCKM). Object-oriented modeling was used for designing its interaction model. The case study method was employed to discuss the two typical practices carried out by Goldcorp Inc. as well as the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency. Findings – This paper proposes the novel KM paradigm called MCKM and also provides its main principles and the interaction model. First, it identifies the gaps between emerging practices and existing KM theories. Second, it embraces the long tails into the scope of organizational KM and extends the scope of prevailing KM studies. Third, it falls back on Pro-Ams to save the costs of and to reduce the risk to organizational KM as well. Fourth, it highlights the advantages of opening organizational internal knowledge and transforms the core beliefs in conventional KM. Finally, it classifies organizational knowledge into two types, domain knowledge and non-domain knowledge, and provides some managing policies, respectively. Practical implications – Introducing MCKM into organizational KM will not only enhance the organizational knowledge creation and sharing, but also help an organization build its open knowledge ecosystem. Originality/value – This is a paper to introduce a new direction of KM studies, which guides an organization to build an open knowledge ecosystem by implementing mass collaborations and taking advantages of the complementary advantages of men and machines in knowledge processing. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Knowledge management; Libraries; Library management; Mass collaboration","","","","","","","","Mechanical Turk is a marketplace for work, (2005); Awazu Y., Desouza K.C., Open knowledge management: Lessons from the open source revolution, Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 55, 11, pp. 1016-1019, (2004); Bach J., The immaturity of the CMM, American Programmer, 7, 9, (1994); Berners-Lee T., Hendler J., Lassila O., The semantic web, Scientific American, 284, 5, pp. 28-37, (2001); Borjigin C., Man-machine mass collaborative knowledge management model, Journal of Library Science in China, 37, 5, pp. 101-114, (2011); Borjigin C., Mass collaborative knowledge processing on the amazon mechanical turk, International Journal of Computer Science Issues, 11, 1, pp. 30-38, (2014); Knowledge Management: A Guide to Good Practice, (2001); Brown J.S., Duguid P., Organizational learning and communities-of-practice: Toward a unified view of working, learning, and innovation, Organization science, 2, 1, pp. 40-57, (1991); Charles A., Tryon J., Managing Organizational Knowledge: 3rd Generation Knowledge Management and Beyond, (2012); Dalkir K., Knowledge Management in Theory and Practice, (2013); Drucker P.F., Harvard Business Review On Knowledge Management, (1998); Firestone J.M., The new knowledge management: A paradigm and its problems, (2009); Firestone J.M., McElroy M.W., Key Issues in the new Knowledge Management, (2003); Garcia-Murillo M., Annabi H., Customer knowledge management, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 53, 8, pp. 875-884, (2002); Gee J.P., Games, learning, and 21st century survival skills, Journal for Virtual Worlds Research, 2, 1, pp. 4-9, (2009); Hendler J., Golbeck J., Metcalfe's law, Web 2. 0, and the semantic web, Web Semantics: Science, Services and Agents on the World Wide Web, 6, 1, pp. 14-20, (2008); Jennex M.E., Open source knowledge management, Int J Knowl Manag, 2, 4, pp. i-iv, (2006); Karl M.W., What future knowledge management users may expect, Journal of Knowledge Management, 32, 2, pp. 155-165, (1999); Karl M.W., People-focussed Knowledge Management: How Effective Decision Making Leads to Corporate Success, (2004); Dalkir K., Knowledge Management in Theory and Practice, (2005); Lassila O., Hendler J., Embracing Web 3. 0, Internet Computing, IEEE, 11, 3, pp. 90-93, (2007); Leadbeater C., Miller P., The Pro-Am Revolution: How Enthusiasts are Changing our Economy and Society, (2004); Lee M.C., Chang T., Applying TQM, CMM and ISO 9001 in knowledge management for software development process improvement, International Journal of Services and Standards, 2, 1, pp. 101-115, (2006); Lemen C., Human-machine cooperation knowledge processing model on semantic web, Library and Information Service, 53, 24, pp. 115-119, (2009); Lemen C., Mass Collaborative Knowledge Management, (2014); Levy M., Web 2. 0 implications on knowledge management, Journal of Knowledge Management, 13, 1, pp. 120-134, (2009); Longbing C., Ruwei D., Architecture of internet-based hall for workshop of metasynthetic engineering, Computer Science, 29, 6, pp. 63-66, (2002); McElroy M.W., Second-generation knowledge management, Knowledge Management, 10, 10, pp. 86-88, (1999); McElroy M.W., Integrating complexity theory, knowledge management and organizational learning, Journal of Knowledge Management, 4, 3, pp. 195-203, (2000); McElroy M.W., Second-generation KM: A white paper.

Based on the SDG goal # 17 (The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals) on the importance of creating partnership, we examine the structures, strategies, and processes designed by the Israel Innovation Institute (III) in the creation of communities and innovation ecosystems. Our research questions are what are the processes and strategies applied to create an ecosystem for an innovation community and to advance partnerships, and how do they evolve and develop. Based on data from interviews, participant observations, and document analysis, we analyzed the pre-conditions for establishing these communities and innovation ecosystems, the community managers’ main strategies, and the processes in which these ecosystems evolve and develop. We find that the III creates a bottom-up process based on three inter-related functions: the creating encounters or partnerships within the community, leading to a second level of collaboration based on bringing various actors, knowledge, and resources from institutions or large organizations outside the original community. These functions lead to further reconfiguring the system higher-order change by setting additional encounters with multinational actors, state actors, and more. This study has significant policy implications for facilitating innovation for complex societal challenges. © 2023 by the authors.","communities; ecosystem; innovation; learning; management; open-innovation; partnerships; platforms; strategies","Israel; ecosystem; innovation; learning; management; partnership approach; Sustainable Development Goal","","","","","Eshcol Center; Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, Israel, (0326000 2017–2020)","This research was funded by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, Israel grant # 0326000 2017–2020 and the Eshcol Center at the Hebrew University 2021 to Amalya Oliver.

We hence study when and how innovation clusters strengthen innovation at firm level. We review insights in this topic from different theoretical perspectives, for example, neoclassical economics, evolutionary economics, behavioral economics, strategic management and open innovation, in search of a comprehensive theoretical framework that explains the relationship between firm innovation and the concentration of innovative activities in the proximity. We then deduce five strengths which drive technological change in innovation clusters, namely attraction, information, interaction, anticipation, and rivalry. The model has implications for researchers, managers, and policymakers and contributes to our understanding of the acceleration of innovation within clusters © 2018, The Author(s).","anticipation; attraction;

Although prior research has discussed several solutions to balance sharing with protecting, these practices either tend to lay too much or not enough emphasis on knowledge protection. In this article, we complement current research by examining whether the formal control mechanisms, prespecified behaviors and prespecified outcomes, may serve as more efficacious project management solutions. We investigate their effect on OI project performance and knowledge leakage and compare their influence with that of contracts, using a data set of 106 new product OI projects in high-technology industries. We find that prespecified behaviors influence project performance in the form of an inverted U-shape, while prespecified outcome increases project performance in a linear fashion. Contracts decrease knowledge leakage while having no influence on project performance. Our study contributes to a more elevated understanding of the role of project management in coping better with the inherent sharing-protecting tension in OI. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd, APM and IPMA","Formal control; Open innovation; Project management","Knowledge management; 'current; Control mechanism; Exchange process; Formal controls; Innovation programs; Knowledge exchange; Knowledge protection; Knowledge-sharing; Open innovation; Project performance; coping strategy; innovation; knowledge based system; performance assessment; project management; Project management","","","","","","","Adler P.S., Borys B., Two types of bureaucracy: Enabling and coercive, Administrative Science Quarterly, 41, 1, pp. 61-89, (1996); Amit R., Schoemaker P.J., Strategic assets and organizational rent, Strategic Management Journal, 14, pp. 33-46, (1993); Appleyard M.M., Chesbrough H.W., The dynamics of open strategy: From adoption to reversion, Long Range Planning, 50, 3, pp. 310-321, (2017); Armstrong J.S., Overton T.S., Estimating nonresponse bias in mail surveys, Journal of Marketing Research, 14, 3, pp. 396-402, (1977); Arora A., Athreye S., Huang C., The paradox of openness revisited: Collaborative innovation and patenting by UK innovators, Research Policy, 45, 7, pp. 1352-1361, (2016); Barbosa A.P., Salerno M.S., Nascimento P.T., Albala A., Maranzato F.P., Tamoschus D., Configuration of project management practices to enhance the performance of open innovation R&D projects, International Journal of Project Management, 39, 2, pp. 128-138, (2021); Barnes T.A., Pashby I.R., Gibbons A.M., Managing collaborative R&D projects development of a practical management tool, International Journal of Project Management, 24, 5, pp. 395-404, (2006); Becker J.-M., Rai A., Ringle C.M., Volckner F., Discovering unobserved heterogeneity in structural equation models to avert validity threats, MIS Quarterly, 37, 3, pp. 665-694, (2013); Belso-Martinez J.A., Exposito-Langa M., Tomas-Miquel J.V., Knowledge network dynamics in clusters: Past performance and absorptive capacity, Baltic Journal of Management, 11, 3, pp. 310-327, (2016); Blindenbach-Driessen F., Van Dalen J., Van Den Ende J., Subjective performance assessment of innovation projects, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 27, 4, pp. 572-592, (2010); Bogers M., The open innovation paradox: knowledge sharing and protection in R&D collaborations, European Journal of Innovation Management, 14, 1, pp. 93-117, (2011); Bonesso S., Comacchio A., Pizzi C., Bonesso S., Comacchio A., Pizzi C., Open Innovation at project level: Key issues and future research agenda, Project-based knowledge in organizing open innovation, pp. 85-95, (2014); Boscherini L., Chiaroni D., Chiesa V., Frattini F., How to use pilot projects to implement open innovation, International Journal of Innovation Management, 14, 6, pp. 1065-1097, (2010); Bozeman B., Fay D., Slade C.P., Research collaboration in universities and academic entrepreneurship: The-state-of-the-art, Journal of Technology Transfer, 38, pp. 1-67, (2013); Brown S., Eisenhardt K.M., The art of continuous change: Linking complexity theory and time-paced evolution in relentlessly shifting organizations, Administrative Science Quarterly, 42, 1, pp. 1-34, (1997); Brunswicker S., Chesbrough H.W., The adoption of open innovation in large firms, Research-Technology Management, 61, 1, pp. 35-45, (2018); Bstieler L., Hemmert M., The effectiveness of relational and contractual governance in new product development collaborations: Evidence from Korea, Technovation, 45-46, pp. 29-39, (2015); Burns T., Stalker G.M., The management of innovation, (1961); Cardinal L.B., Technological innovation in the pharmaceutical industry: The use of organizational control in managing research and development, Organization Science, 12, 1, pp. 19-36, (2001); Carver C.S., Scheier M.F., On the self-regulation of behavior, (1998); Cavusgil S.T., Deligonul S., Zhang C., Curbing foreign distributor opportunism: An examination of trust, contracts, and the legal environment in international channel relationships, Journal of International Marketing, 12, 2, pp. 7-27, (2004); Chesbrough H.W., Open innovation: The new imperative for creating and profiting from technology, (2003); Chesbrough H.W., Bogers M., Chesbrough H.W., Vanhaverbeke W., West J., Explicating open innovation: claryfing an emerging paradigm for understanding innovation, New frontiers in open innovation, pp. 3-28, (2014); Chesbrough H.W., Brunswicker S., A fad or a phenomenon?

Consequently, the present paper propose an in-depth analysis of the characteristics of the virtual communities of practice that drive the innovative development of web applications. The driving research questions are: Which are the preeminent characteristics of practice communities that can favor the process of creation and realization of a web application? Do these characteristics differ in the different phases of web-application building project (ideation, design, realization and verify)? We adopted a multiple case study research design. After a selection of communities of practice related to the development of a web application, we obtained a sample of 46 communities of practice. We classified them basing on the different processes that support the different phases of the innovation process in software development analyzing six important characteristics for each one. The results of the empirical analysis shows that best practices are: In reference to members' involvement (strategies to attract and to permit to collaborate), the use of open source projects or challenges as organizational and working models to attract and to motivate community's members and strategies like royalties concession, direct charging of participation task from the community and fixed project deadline as form of incentives to be used; In reference to the role of the community and of community members in software development, the support from other developers, involvement of professional developer and direct contact as form of strategies of collaboration.","Innovation; Online communities of practice; Web applications projects","Knowledge management; Online systems; Open source software; Open systems; Planning; Social networking (online); Communities of Practice; Innovation process; Multiple-case study; On-line communities; Open source projects; Research questions; Virtual communities of practices; WEB application; Software design","","","","","","","Akoumianakis D., Cross-organization virtual CoP: A field study in an information-based industry, (2011); Battistella C., Nonino F., Exploring the impact of motivations on the attraction of innovation roles in open innovation web-based platforms, Production planning and control, 24, 4-5, pp. 226-245, (2013); Baxter G.J., Implementing Web 2.0 tools in organisations, Learning Organization, 21, 1, pp. 2-5, (2014); Borzillo S., Kaminska-Labbe R., Unravelling the dynamics of knowledge creation in communities of practice though complexity theory lenses, Knowledge Management Research and Practice, 9, pp. 353-366, (2011); Bouchamma Y., Michaud C., Professional development of supervisors through professional learning communities, International Journal of Leadership in Education, 17, 1, pp. 62-82, (2014); Chandra R., Iyer R.S., Raman R., Enabling organizations to implement smarter, customized social computing platforms by leveraging knowledge flow patterns, Journal of Knowledge Management, 19, 1, pp. 95-107, (2015); Chidambaram L., Bostrom R., Evolution of group performance over time: a repeated measures study of GDSS effects, Journal of Organizational Computing, 3, 4, pp. 443-469, (1993); Chu M.T., Krishnakumar P., Khosla R., Mapping knowledge sharing traits to business strategy in knowledge based organisation, Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, 25, 1, pp. 55-65, (2014); Cordery J.L., Cripps E., Gibson C.B., Kirkman B.L., Mathieu J.E., The Operational Impact of Organizational Communities of Practice: A Bayesian Approach to Analyzing Organizational Change, Journal of Management, 41, 2, pp. 644-664, (2015); Cox A., What are communities of practice?

We use a quantitative approach based on fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) of survey data from 251 executive directors of hotels from Portuguese small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The results allow visualization of the interactions of inbound and outbound open innovation with corporate risk management and organizational strategy in order to generate competitive advantage. The results demonstrate that corporate risk management is a keystone for a competitive cost advantage, whereas inbound open innovation plays a fundamental role in obtaining competitive advantages for products and services. Other factors, such as outbound open innovation or those linked with organizational strategy, have less impact, and/or the sign of their influence depends on the configuration of the remaining variables. © 2022 by the authors.","competitive advantage; configurational analysis; corporate risk management; fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis; hotel industry; inbound open innovation; organizational strategy; outbound open innovation","","","","","","Universitat de Barcelona, UB, (DB.00.18.00); Universitat Rovira i Virgili","This research was supported by Telefonica and its Telefonica Chair on Smart Cities of the Universitat Rovira i Virgili and Universitat de Barcelona (project number 42.

Today, a successful company should be, lean, modular, and with a smart approach to new products development. In this context, the source of competitive advantage cannot be found into a static heterogeneity of resources, but companies must be able to create and manage a dynamic competitive process to continuously reinvent their products/services and to re-combine their resources with their partners' ones. A paradigm for this behavior is the Open Innovation one, as created by Chesbrough. According to the rules of this paradigm, companies have to acknowledge that they operate in a network of relationships, they must be open to cooperate with their external partners, and they must not try to limit their actions in reaching only for some pre-defined result. So, Open Innovation Networks appear to be similar to those described by the scholars in the Complex Adaptive Systems field where the actions of the system, and of its parts, are the result of the various actors' interactions in an emergent way. In this paper, we use a Systematic Literature Review approach to explore how the main topics in the System Thinking Perspective, and in particular, those related to Complex Systems, are linked to the Open Innovation studies. © 2018 by the authors.","Complex Systems; Innovation; Interactions; Open Innovation; Resource-based theory; System thinking; Systematic literature review","","","","","","","","Hacklin F., Raurich V., Marxt C., Implications of technological convergence on innovation trajectories: The case of ICT industry, Int.

Firms following open innovation recognize the value of external inputs to the process of new product development and seek to utilize these inputs internally. Therefore, it is imperative to investigate the success of new product as open innovation may influence the success in different ways. This study focuses on the four distinct elements in the process of developing a new product: Planning, Development, Marketing and Commercialization. In addition, this paper points to another two areas that have not been covered by previous researchers: organizational structure and contextual factors. It is suggested that these factors have moderating effect on the relationship between open innovation and NPD process. Subsequently, a conceptual framework is proposed. © 2012 IEEE.","NPD success factors; open innovation; organizational contextual factors; organizational structure","Product development; Research; Conceptual frameworks; Contextual factors; Distinct elements; External input; Moderating effect; New product; New product development; Open innovation; Organization structures; Organizational structures; Success factors; Innovation","","","","","","","McNally R.C., Akdeniz M.B., Calantone R.J., New Product Development Processes and New Product Profitability: Exploring the Mediating Role of Speed to Market and Product Quality, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 28, pp. 63-77, (2011); Li H., Atuahene-Gima K., Product innovation strategy and the performance of new technology ventures in China, Academy of Management Journal, 44, 6, pp. 1123-1134, (2001); Vorhies D.W., Morgan N.A., Benchmarking marketing capabilities for sustainable competitive advantage, Journal of Marketing, 69, 1, pp. 80-94, (2005); Schmidt J.B., Calantone R.J., Escalation of commitment during new product development, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 30, 2, (2002); Green D.H., Barclay D.W., Ryans A.B., Entry strategy and long-term performance: Conceptualization and empirical examination, The Journal of Marketing, 59, 4, pp. 1-16, (1995); Cooper R.G., Edgett S.J., Kleinschmidt E.J., Benchmarking best NPD practices-II, Research Technology Management, 47, 3, pp. 50-59, (2004); Cooper R.G., Process model for industrial new product development, IEEE Trans.

Nevertheless, studies have recently started to demonstrate that different organizational factors mediate this relation under the controvertible assumption that companies are capable of responding quickly to market changes using their IT in combination with other internal resources. Therefore, companies have given very little attention to collaborative work with external partners. The purpose of this study is to analyze the mediating effects of the acquisition and exploitation capabilities of open innovation on the information technology capabilities – organizational agility relationship. Design/methodology/approach: Structural equation modeling was used to test the proposed model with survey data from a multinational corporation that operates in South American emerging economies in the pension and savings businesses. Findings: This study found that only the open innovation capability of exploitation has a partial mediating effect. This means that this organizational ability serves as a bridge so that IT capabilities can have a positive incidence on organizational agility. Originality/value: This paper adopts a more novel study focus that emphasizes the importance of collaborative work and of the use of external resources that are implicit in open innovation capability. On the other hand, this organizational ability implies external embeddedness, which is usually approached mainly from the network theory in the international business literature; however, this study offers a more interesting study focus in which externally oriented organizational abilities such as open innovation are more important for external embeddedness than are the size and quality of the external network. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Dual embeddedness;

However, innovative design in an open environment faces three challenges: difficulty in gathering distributed design resources, low accuracy in matching tasks and resources, and high uncertainty in the design process, which in turn leads to the deterioration of the product design ecology. For addressing these problems, crowdsourcing design theory based on collective intelligence collaborative innovation was put forward. Then a theoretical system of crowdsourcing design was established from two aspects, including the micro-level of the product design process and the macro-system level of the aggregation of collective intelligence. The proposed theoretical system conducted a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the dynamic change mechanism of the design process and various activities in crowdsourcing design. These works were expected to provide theoretical reference for product crowdsourcing design practice. © 2022 CIMS.

Studying archival data, documentation, and interviews, we found that the two firms exhibited five periods that were characterised by different open innovation activities and R&D capabilities. In their early stages, the two firms lacked R&D functions; thus, they imported technologies and pursued production-oriented strategies. As they gradually entered into collaborations and established their R&D departments, open innovation and IP protection played important and dynamic roles in this process. Thus, a catch-up process involves not only acquiring technological capabilities and innovative competencies but also transforming a firm's capacity to strategies. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","catch-up; developing economy; intellectual property; open innovation; pharmaceutical industry","China; developing world; innovation; intellectual property rights; pharmaceutical industry; research and development","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","Shengce Ren (Ph.D. of Strategic Management, Shanghai JiaoTong University) is Associate Professor and Business Administration Department Head in Shanghai Maritime University.

As nations increasingly rely on knowledge assets to grow, the adoption of OSS will have profound economic consequences. This paper identifies the mechanisms inherent to OSS production that help fuel innovation in knowledge-based economies. As a collaborative and open production model, OSS is conceptualized as a prototype of open innovation. Drawing on US employment projections for 2008-2018, the authors' analysis predicts OSS will have a positive impact on employment growth in well-paid salary jobs across multiple sectors of the US economy. OSS-related software development jobs are widely diffuse throughout the economy, help build a skilled labour force and offer wages significantly above the national average. OSS is thus believed to be a strong contributor to growth in high-value employment in the US. The authors also posit that, as industries are exposed to the benefits of OSS as a result of the broad diffusion of OSS-related jobs, open innovation processes outside software development may be adopted through a process of learning and imitation. © 2015, IGI Global.

Partial solutions caused by this fragmentation will only increase the number of conflicting issues that need resolving. Thereto, this paper offers seven perspectives for addressing innovation in networked structures, especially by evaluating the perspectives against the particular characteristics of Living Labs. None of these perspectives, based on a literature review and supported by empirical evidence, offers a complete picture of innovation that crosses the organizational boundaries of the monolithic firm. To understand and solve challenges related to Living Labs, a more integrated and comprehensive view becomes necessary based on the integration of the individual perspectives. In addition, a research agenda for Living Labs follows from the issues emerging from the review of the perspectives.

Previous research has highlighted the risk that TQM might impede firms' ability to innovate and quickly adapt to changes, especially in rapidly changing environments. However, other researchers have concluded that some of the best practices of innovation management could be recognised as TQM elements. A recurring issue concerns the conceptualisation of TQM that is contributing to ambiguity, as there are various definitions. The question of whether TQM supports innovation or not is, therefore, unsettled. The purpose of this paper was to compare Organisational Characteristics for Continuous Innovation (OCCI) in rapidly changing industries with key TQM Principles in order to discuss the relationship between TQM and continuous innovation. The OCCI used for the comparison have been generated through an empirical study of Google in combination with a literature review of research on continuous innovation in fast-changing environments. A comparison with the OCCI reveals that there are many similarities with TQM principles but also some distinct differences, for example, in terms of orientation towards innovation. While TQM has become closely related to process orientation, OCCI are more related to semi-structure and ambidexterity. The conclusion is that TQM needs to change in order to also support continuous innovation. In order for TQM to contribute both to continuous improvement and continuous innovations, a partly new management paradigm is needed. However, even if TQM is changed, the brand 'TQM' is still associated with 'quality' and 'continuous improvement'. A re-branding strategy might, therefore, be necessary. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","ambidextrous organisation; continuous innovation; corporate culture; dynamic capabilities; Google; management innovation; open innovation; TQM","","","","","","","","Akao Y., Quality function deployment, (1990); Alange S., Total quality management as a tool for organizational change (CIM Working Papers, WP 1992-01, (1992); Alange S., The new paradigm for industrial practices: Total quality management in 1994 (CIM Working Papers, WP 1994-01), (1994); Alange S., Lindstrom J., Wedel P., Intryck och Tankar om Kvalitet - inspirerade av ett besök i Japan under oktober 1987, (1987); Antony J., Six Sigma: A strategy for supporting innovation in pursuit of business excellence - invited paper, International Journal of Technology Management, 37, 1-2, pp. 8-12, (2007); Benner M., Dynamic or static capabilities?

We identify three new issues for the Cross-Functional Consortium Families (CFCFs, CF2s) open innovation model based on a cooperating network: participation of large-scale high-tech enterprises (LHEs), impact from open source, and motivation of keeping resource independence. By studying the series cases of Tesla, Inc. (Austin, TX, USA) cooperating with small and medium enterprises (SMEs) through an open source CF2 model, we examined and discussed these three issues and gave new connotations to both open innovation and the CF2 model from perspectives of open source and resources. This paper also provides strategic reference for other LHEs to mitigate the dependency on key resources and generate new key resources accepted by the environment. © 2021 by the authors.

Ecosystems are intrinsically more fluid than networks, which set ups the need to understand and orchestrate the internal dynamics of innovation ecosystem in order to have successful innovation outcomes. The dynamics of ecosystems, however, is not well understood. In this paper the dynamics of innovation ecosystems has been studied by applying the methodology of system dynamics. The purpose of the study is to support the creation of innovation ecosystems and the orchestration of existing ecosystems so that they could be more successful. Key factors generating dynamics in innovation ecosystems were identified. They form the elements of the system dynamics model of innovation ecosystems. The causal loop structure between the model elements indicates how the key factors of dynamics influence the outcome of ecosystem. © 2022 China Ordnance Society","Ecosystem; Innovation ecosystem; Modeling; Open innovation; System dynamics","","","","","","VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd. and Business Finland","This study has been undertaken within internal projects on innovation ecosystem governance and impacts and the solid value of digitization in the forest industry (SEED).

As the phenomenon needs to be explored at the level of decision-making in SMEs, the concept of OI moves is considered. An OI move consists of two integrally linked core aspects of OI: (a) the type of partner collaborating with an SME (who is making the cake) and (b) the exploitation mode (who is eating the cake). The coalescence of these two core aspects formulates a typology of OI moves used in this research as a coding framework. Drawing from a dataset of 106 in-depth case studies of innovation projects of European SMEs, this research enables the discovery of evidence-based key success factors and challenges, the knowledge of which can benefit SME managers. In addition to generic tactics for success for each type of OI move, this paper outlines three lessons for SME managers engaging in OI: (a) OI managerial skills alone are not sufficient—an open social attitude must be developed; (b) an OI project is a learning journey; (c) starting with the aim of ‘solving a problem’ and, in turn, ‘finding a problem’ (worth solving) is a recipe for success. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Business strategies; Open innovation; SMEs; Success factors","","","","","","European Commission, EC; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (691440); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020","This research is based on data collected by the INSPIRE project (H2020 project under grant agreement No 691440) funded by the European Commission.

While earlier work has elaborated on the advantages of leveraging the knowledge of external contributors, our findings show that organizational attempts to attract such involvement are likely to wither and die. We develop arguments about what increases the likelihood of getting suggestions from externals in the future, namely through (1) proactive attention (submitting internally developed suggestions to externals to stimulate debate) and (2) reactive attention (paying attention to suggestions from externals to signal they are being listened to), particularly when those suggestions are submitted by newcomers. Findings from an analysis of about 24,000 initiatives by organizations to involve external contributors suggest these actions are crucial for receiving suggestions from external contributors. Our results are contingent upon the stage of the initiative because organizations' actions exert more influence in initiatives that lack a history of prior suggestions. Our work has implications for scholars of open innovation because it highlights the importance of considering failures as well successes: focusing exclusively on initiatives that reach a certain stage can lead to partial or erroneous conclusions about why some organizations engage external contributors while others fail. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Attention; Ideation; Open innovation; Openness; Social media; Success bias; Suggestions; User innovation","Innovation; Knowledge management; Attention; Ideation; Open innovation; Openness; Social media; Success bias; Suggestions; User innovation; Societies and institutions","","","","","Peter Curtius Foundation; Stanford Technology Venture Program; Stanford Institute for Research in the Social Sciences, IRiSS","Both authors contributed equally.

However, questions are being raised about the limitations imposed by this classification—for both academic research and policy design. LT firms over time can develop rich knowledge related to non R&D activities while simultaneously exploiting new and high technologies to develop new products and processes. Therefore, policies to support innovation should take account of the fact that LT sectors are an important component of the national innovation ecosystem. For instance, the food sector despite its relatively low formal R&D activity, has developed a significant knowledge base related to non-R&D activities. Also, technological change related to other sectors can affect the whole agro-food value chain, and create opportunities related to technological advancements in areas such as information and communication technologies, biotechnologies, nutrition, health-care, etc. In this paper, we investigate the impact of technology transfer on the business performance and competitiveness of young European food and beverages firms, using data from AEGIS—a large-scale survey. We explore whether firms which use technology transfer mechanisms exhibit better business and competitive performance than firms with less open strategies. Our findings contribute to ongoing discussion on the growth and innovation potential of traditional industries. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Food industry; Low tech industries; Open innovation; Technology transfer","Knowledge based systems; Technology transfer; Competitive performance; Dynamic transformation; Food industries; Information and Communication Technologies; Manufacturing industries; Open innovation; Technological advancement; Technological change; Competition","","","","","Aegis Foundation; European Commission, EC, (225134)","Acknowledgements This paper uses data derived from the ‘‘Advancing knowledge-intensive Entrepreneurship and innovation for economic Growth and Social well-being in Europe’’ (AEGIS) project funded by the European Commission (Grant Agreement number 225134).

Customer agility captures the extent to which a firm is able to sense and respond quickly to customer-based opportunities for innovation and competitive action. Drawing from the dynamic capability and IT business value research streams, we propose that IT plays an important role in facilitating a ""knowledge creating"" synergy derived from the interaction between a firm's Web-based customer infrastructure and its analytical ability. This will enhance the firm's ability to sense customer-based opportunities. IT also plays an important role in ""process enhancing"" synergy obtained from the interaction between a firm's coordination efforts and its level of information systems integration, which facilitates the firm's ability to respond to those opportunities. We also leverage the competitive dynamics and strategic alignment literature to propose that the alignment between customer-sensing capability and customer-responding capability will impact the firm's competitive activity. We test our model with a two-stage research design in which we survey marketing executives of high-tech firms. Our results show that a Web-based customer infrastructure facilitates a firm's customer-sensing capability; furthermore, analytical ability positively moderates this relationship. We also find that internal systems integration positively moderates the relationship between interfunctional coordination and a firm's customer-responding capability. Finally, our results show that agility alignment affects the efficacy of a firm's competitive actions. In particular, action efficacy is higher when sensing and responding capabilities are both high. © 2012 M.E.

By complementing the concept of absorptive capacity, we advance towards a capability-based framework for open innovation processes. We identify the following six 'knowledge capacities' as a firm's critical capabilities of managing internal and external knowledge in open innovation processes: inventive, absorptive, transformative, connective, innovative, and desorptive capacity. 'Knowledge management capacity' is a dynamic capability, which reconfigures and realigns the knowledge capacities. It refers to a firm's ability to successfully manage its knowledge base over time. The concept may be regarded as a framework for open innovation, as a complement to absorptive capacity, and as a move towards understanding dynamic capabilities for managing knowledge. On this basis, it contributes to explaining interfirm heterogeneity in knowledge and alliance strategies, organizational boundaries, and innovation performance. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","","","","","","","","","Ambos T., Makela K., Birkinshaw J., D'Este P., When does university research get commercialized?
